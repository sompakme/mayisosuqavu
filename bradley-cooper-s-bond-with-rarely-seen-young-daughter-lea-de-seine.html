To have a child not grow up in that way…<strong>&nbsp;I want her to have, as much as she can, a foundation that's like 25 feet thick, cement, that she can walk on this earth with. That's the goal."</strong></p><p id=eT6pZ1BYcQZ data-wc=65>Meanwhile, Bradley and Irina have both opened up about how they find life as parents. The Oscar-nominee told NPR back in 2018: "Having a child and having a family of my own — which is a miracle and something I've always dreamt of — has opened me up even more to the day, and to be present. I just always want [Lea] to feel loved."</p><p id=e4BxlZ9uDsL data-wc=22>The year after, he told Oprah Winfrey that his daughter often reminds him of his late father, Charles. <strong>"Our daughter, she's incredible.&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0a0273ac5ee4-bradley-cooper.jpg><p id=eXyu1sy-lW data-wc=49>"And I see my father in her quite often. I can't believe I'm going to admit this, but I had moments when I was in the room with her, I would say, 'Dad?' There are some moments where she looks just like my father. I watch too many movies."</p><p id=e5V7kw58dQQ data-wc=39>In an interview with ELLE just last November, Irina opened up a little about their co-parenting dynamic. <strong>"He's the best father Lea and I could dream of.
