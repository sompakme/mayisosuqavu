Tennis is cool, but I really miss my daughter. We’ve already gone to Australia for a long time with her, we’re going to go back to the United States for a long time so we don’t want to disorient her too much either. It’s a challenge.”</p><p>Monfils became professional in 2004, when he was just&nbsp;18 years old.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:&nbsp;<a href=#>Gael Monfils builds his perfect tennis player, ft.
