So, let's delve into the recent developments in Colorado's gun laws and make certain that we are all responsible and well-informed firearm users.</p><h2><span>Colorado Gun Laws Prohibit Certain People From Possessing Firearms</span></h2><p>According to Colorado gun laws in 2023, possessing or carrying a gun, even one that is legally owned, is illegal under specific circumstances. These include:</p><ul><li>Being the subject of a protective order that prohibits gun possession</li><li>Being a fugitive from justice, being addicted to a controlled substance</li><li>Being adjudicated as a “mentally defective” or committed to a mental institution</li><li>Being illegally or unlawfully present in the United States</li><li>Being discharged from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions</li><li>Anyone convicted of a violent misdemeanor within the last five years</li></ul><p>Additionally, those who have renounced their U.S. citizenship or have been convicted of certain crimes under state or federal law are also prohibited from possessing firearms.</p><p>Before purchasing a firearm, individuals must pass a universal background check administered by a licensed firearms dealer, regardless of whether the transaction takes place in private or in public, such as at a shop or a gun show. There is no mandatory waiting period when purchasing a firearm, but individuals must be at least 18 years old to buy a rifle or shotgun and at least 21 years old to buy a handgun. Colorado does not require firearm registration by state law, despite stricter gun laws following the Columbine Massacre in 1999.</p><h2><span>2023 Colorado Gun Laws - What’s Legal To Own?</span></h2><p>In Colorado, there are certain firearms that are legal to possess.

Individuals who are otherwise permitted to possess firearms may open carry these weapons in the state without needing a permit. However, there are some locations where the concealed or open carrying of firearms is prohibited.

A first-time offense is a misdemeanor punishable by up to 364 days in jail and a fine of up to $1,000.
