I got your kids but you got a lot of kids.’ I think he was looking down laughing at that one.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Superior also revealed what it was like to see DMX in such a hard state at the end of his life. “It&nbsp;was hard to see him laid out like that, but how I saw it is the world couldn’t hurt him anymore.&nbsp;People were always taking his money, using him, misusing his funds, smiling in his face and then talking bad about him.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“After he blew up and got the big record deal, the first thing he did was give money to fix a church’s roof,” Superior told The Sun.&nbsp;“It was like $2 million. But the church never got it. Whoever handled the money messed it up.” He went on to say, “X&nbsp;didn’t worship money. It was never about that for him. It’s sad talking about X. We lost a legend. Look the impact DMX had on the world. He came from nothing and built himself up.”</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Hayley Hynes is the former Weekend Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop, she stepped down after two years in 2024 to pursue other creative opportunities but remains on staff part-time to cover music, gossip, and pop culture news.
