It was beef that he inherited through his affiliation with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Wayne</a>. The rivalry dates all the way back to Push's time as a member of Clipse in the 2000s. Subsequently, the pair traded bars about each other on a pair of songs one of which made it onto Push's 2018 album <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Daytona</a>. But the most memorable part of the beef came when Pusha T released his Story Of Adidon diss track. The song revealed to the world that Drake was hiding a secret child. It also used a picture of the rapper in blackface as its artwork.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Now 5 years later Drizzy may have some interest in restarting the beef. Lyrics on a song from his new album seem to subtly take aim at his former rival. The second verse on "Fear Of Heights" features a series of bars that could be interpreted as shots at Push via his wife Virginia. "Virginia, I pull up and chill/You know you can't come where I stay/'Fore you get caught on a date/'Fore you get put on a plate/'Fore you get slid on like skates/'Fore I get turned up like bass/I know that look on they face/Don't tell me you're scared of lil Drake," the song's lyrics read. Check out the full verse below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-drake-s-newest-alleged-pusha-t-diss>Drake's Newest Alleged Pusha T Diss</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">If he is dissing Pusha T, that wouldn't even be the only diss on the song. He spends much of the opening verse <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">taking aim at Rihanna</a>. It happens through a series of bars referencing her music, nicknames, and relationship with A$AP Rocky. Additionally those are far from the only alleged disses on the album either.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Later on the album, Drake <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">name-drops The Weeknd directly</a>. While fans aren't in agreement on whether it was intended as a direct diss, it certainly seems like it at first glance. Do you think Drake is trying to diss Pusha T again on his new album?
