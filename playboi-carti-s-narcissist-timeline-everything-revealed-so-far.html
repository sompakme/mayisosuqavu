That's it, no extra information. Was Narcissist a new album? Or just some merch? Or both? Or neither?</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">There's been a recent development of musicians revealing their new projects piecemeal, slowly trickling out info via social media seemingly so their fans can obsess over every new detail that slowly emerges.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh"><a href=#>Kanye</a>'s super-delayed <a href=#>DONDA </a>debut set the standard for <a href=#>this kind of tease</a>, but there have been more than a <a href=#>few like-minded rollouts</a> from Drake and Kanye.</p><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Instagram post.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Narcissist, Carti's new thing, was supposed to be revealed on September 13, according to Instagram posts uploaded on August 23, August 31, and September 12.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Instead, it's been the subject of a bizarre saga that nearly rivals Kanye's DONDA delays for the year's <a href=#>oddest album rollout</a>.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Carti's initial Instagram posts were rich with intrigue, showcasing someone (it was never clear if it's actually Carti) layered up in loads of <a href=#>Balenciaga</a>.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">The posts announcing Narcissist are still the only thing on Carti's Instagram, which even lacks an avatar. It was never even clear if Narcissist is even music-related. It could've merely been Carti celebrating his birthday.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Nope! Turns out that Narcissist is indeed a new album, or song, or something. Okay, so still pretty vague but Narcissist does share its name with a forthcoming tour and merch that suddenly appeared on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Playboi Carti's web store</a> September 13.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">In fact, Carti and Uzi were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">spotted</a> wearing some of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">still-unreleased goods</a>, distinguished by a stylized "Narcissist" print.</p><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Instagram post.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Fans hoping for Narcissist to be a new Carti album were doubly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">let down</a> by the merch reveal. It's no longer visible on Carti's site but the prices were shockingly high: a motorcycle helmet, only shown as a render, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">retailed for $5,000</a> (and wouldn't ship until Spring 2022).</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Then, everything was shut back down as suddenly as it emerged. Carti made a rare appearance on Twitter to make two statements. "THE WEBSITE IS HACKED," he said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">in an iMessage screenshot</a>. "NEVER APPROVED ANY CLOTHING/ ETC [sic]" followed by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">an order</a> in a different iMessage chat: "DROP NARCISSIST."</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">That was on September 15 and, unsurprisingly, neither an album nor official merch have been released yet, not even the gear that Uzi and Carti themselves wore earlier this week.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Some fans are still whispering about a forthcoming <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">drop</a> but most have given up on new Carti coming any time soon.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Acccording to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Playboi Carti's website</a> and sites like Spotify, the Narcissist tour is set to kick off October 14 in Nashville, Tennessee.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">On September 26, Carti tweeted out a single word: "Narcissist." For a guy who keeps pretty well to himself, Carti sure does love the attention.</p><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Twitter post.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Finally, more Narcissist billboards have been spotted in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">San Antonio</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Minneapolis</a>, and images were shared on Reddit.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">For some reason, Carti deleted the tour dates he tweeted a while back along with the photos of presumed Narcissist merch. However, the Narcissist tour did start this past weekend, so maybe the album will actually release soon. Or maybe "Narcissist" is just the name of the tour.</p><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Twitter post.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">The only person who knows is King Vamp himself, who hasn't tweeted anything since October 24.</p><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Twitter post.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Meanwhile, Carti is currently on tour with Rico Nasty, who is not enjoying her time on the road as an opener. Reportedly, Carti fans have been booing her and even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">broke down barricades</a> just before Carti took the stage in Houston, a few days after <a href=#>the disastrous Astroworld</a> concert in November.</p><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Twitter post.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Carti now has a couple shows coming through December, following his Rolling Loud appearance, though Narcissist is nowhere to be seen.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Similarly, Carti has been vacant on all of his social media pages aside from his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">@opium_00pium</a> alt, instead focusing on his on-stage get-ups, which prominently feature Balenciaga, <a href=#>Vetements</a>, and <a href=#>motorcycle gloves</a>.</p><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Instagram post.</p>Enable All Media<p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Instagram post.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Carti even teased <a href=#>a line of Whole Lotta Red dolls</a>, styled in his usual wardrobe.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbXGoaqnp5KesrXFjZympmegZL2trdibpqJlk5a%2FtbWMp5irm5mowKq%2F02g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
