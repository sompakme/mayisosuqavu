More specifically, several of her recent off-duty outfits have led to her being heralded as a master of '<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/lifestyle_homes/a43516328/quiet-luxury-lifestyle/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="quiet luxury" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">quiet luxury</a>', which is why her new role as the face of Longines’ new Mini Dolce Vita watch collection could not be a more perfect fit.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The design – which was launched to much fanfare in New York last month, with Lawrence in attendance – is an update on one of the brand’s most iconic watches. It is smaller, more discreet and, well, quietly luxurious. It is also completely in line with Lawrence’s style.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“When you select an ambassador, they need to be credible and understood by the consumer,” Longines CEO Matthias Breschan told me, of why Lawrence has been such a successful choice for the brand. “She mirrors this combination of inner and outer elegance perfectly – she's humble, she's super funny, of course, but she's also incredibly elegant.”</p><img alt="jennifer lawrence for longines" title="jennifer lawrence for longines" width=7338 height=5504 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jennifer-lawrence-longines-1-6512f7c4296e5.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Longines</span></p><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lawrence was first tapped as Longines’ ambassador of elegance last year and has already had a noticeable impact, Breschan says. “There's nothing fake about her – and I think this authenticity is something that people very much appreciate.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lawrence's relationship with watches has been a journey, she says, one which only really began quite recently. “When my husband [the art collector Cooke Maroney] and I got married, my brother-in-law gave me a watch that his father had given him when they were younger,” she told me, when we met in New York ahead of the launch. “It was such a sentimental, amazing gesture and ever since then I’ve had a love for watches. It really grew from there.”</p><img alt="jennifer lawrence for longines" title="jennifer lawrence for longines" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jennifer-lawrence-longines-4-6512f833ab112.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Longines</span></p><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This appreciation of meaningful jewellery is something that has only grown since that 2019 wedding. “In my family we weren’t huge heirloom keepers, but I married into a big sentimental family,” she explained. “Now, one of my favourite pieces is a necklace with dice, which I have because my husband and I love to play backgammon. Obviously, that is very sentimental to me.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, working with Longines has given Lawrence more opportunity to learn about the world of watches, and – as the brand's ambassador of elegance – to consider more deeply how she feels about style. “Elegance always looks better when it’s a little bit more effortless – it’s that idea of quiet luxury,” she says. “It’s being confident; that’s what elegance is about, not trying too hard.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This approach to style can be seen in the classic pieces she wears, and in the heritage brands she invests in. This particular watch is also a perfect example of that. Described by Longines as “a masterpiece that expresses, in equal parts, quiet luxury and contemporary elegance”, the low-key version of this classic timepiece is an excellent investment for that subtle touch of sophistication. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.longines.com/en-gb/mini-dolcevita/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Discover more about the Longines Mini Dolce Vita collection here." class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Discover more about the Longines Mini Dolce Vita collection here.</a></p><img alt=longines title=longines width=6388 height=4791 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/longines-1-6512fbad37ffa.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Longines</span></p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Highlights from the A/W 2023 Couture Shows" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/2023-hbz-aw23couture-thumb-1-64ae6d09d49db.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSzor%2FHoqanZZ6axLR7wG1sbGlna355e8mepaehlpq%2FbrjAsKmeppOaerLByJ6rZqSlrcKzxYysnKesmaKyr8DApWSjnaeaua2x0bJm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
