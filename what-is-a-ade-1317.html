Pass the vision test with flying colors. Make sure you have your permit.</p><p></p><h3>What should I do once I have received my drivers education certificate?</h3><p>Once you have successfully completed the course and passed the final exam, we will mail you a driver’s education completion certificate.

The use of a permit is not required in any circumstances. That is only for minors, or those under the age of eighteen.</p><p></p><h3>What is the best way to parallel park?</h3><p>Listed below are the instructions, which include additional “do it exactly this way”-style highlighting and prompting: Drive around until you find a parking space that appears to be large enough.
