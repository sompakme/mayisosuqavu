"If I was in my hotel room at night, they would take the phone out of the hotel room so I couldn't call room service. Or if there was fruit in my room, they took it out because that's extra sugar." Lovato alluded this to in "Melon Cake," singing, "There was a time I was living as a prisoner inside my own mind.&nbsp;And there was a time where the cat and mouse tried to make me Barbie-sized, and I obliged."</p><p>According to Lovato's account, she was allowed to have fruit on her birthday — a watermelon cake with fat-free whip cream. "It kind of became this ongoing joke, but I just really wanted birthday cake," she admitted. When Lovato made Scooter Braun her manager, she finally got the dessert she had craved for so long.&nbsp;"I just remember crying because I was finally eating cake with a manager that didn't need anything from me and that loved me for who I am," she said.&nbsp;</p><p>Lovato referenced this triumph in the tune, belting out, "Now I'm saying no more melon cakes on birthdays, no more barricades in doorways. Finally get to do things my way."</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know is struggling with an eating disorder, please contact the National Eating Disorder Association's Helpline at 1-800-931-2237 or chat with one of their helpline volunteers on NEDA's <a href=#>website</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG9iaINye9OhnGaqlZa5brnEmqWippdir6a0yKebZpyVorZuuM6vmK2no2K6prjOp2ScmZuafA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
