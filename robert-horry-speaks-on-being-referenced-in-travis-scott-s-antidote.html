The second single on his 2015 debut album Rodeo. The song went four-times platinum, with Scott alluding to it as a song for his true fans. "This is for the real fans; the real ragers! This is some vibes for the summer. This isn’t on Rodeo… it’s coming soon," Scott wrote on Soundcloud. However, due to the popularity of the song, it found its way onto the album. And a good thing that it did, as it helped sparked Travis Scott's early rise.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Antidote" peaked at #17 on the Billboard Hot 100, #7 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop, and #1 on Billboard's Rhythmic Chart. However, the song also contains a reference to the NBA. In one line, Scott says “I just hit a three-peat (Ooh)/ Fucked three hoes I met this week (Robert Horry)". The line refers to Robert Horry, a 16-year veteran and seven-time NBA champion. Horry began his career in Scott's hometown of Houston.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-robert-horry-explains-his-views-on-antidote>Robert Horry Explains His Views On "Antidote"</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Speaking on the All The Smoke podcast, Horry revealed that while he loves the song, it's done him no favors at home. “My current wife hates this song, [but] I love this song. ‘Don’t you open up that window.’ Yeah, Travis Scott. The three-peat. And my wife, every time she hears it she says: ‘Is there something you need to tell me?’ I’m like, ‘Nah, I didn’t get in trouble.'”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">He continued. "I met Travis Scott once. He’s a huge Rockets fan — still is to this day. I met him and almost wanted to say, ‘Why you put me in that song? And what you mean by three-peat three hoes the other week?'” Someone should get the pair of them in a room together so they can hash out the entire meaning behind the song.
