Baccarat Rouge, blended by iconic perfumer Francis Kurkdjian, has an <strong>unabashed presence</strong> and <strong>impressive staying power</strong>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although many fragrance houses describe their perfumes as unique, this one truly is. It’s a neither here nor there scent, as it doesn’t truly fit squarely in one fragrance family, but somehow touches them as the layers unfold with wear. Opening with a <strong>burst of bitter almond</strong> and <strong>spicy saffron</strong>, the aroma dries down into the <strong>floral middle notes of jasmine and earthy cedar</strong>, before settling into a <strong>deeper musky base</strong> of ambergris and fir resin. Because this perfume has such an unusual blend of notes, it smells very different depending on who wears it, from a spicy caramel confection to a sharp metallic aroma.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“This happens because we’re all unique in our body chemistry,” explains Ray Mauro, Brand Manager of Fragrance Development and Marketing at Avon. “Our skin releases oils and the balance of those oils varies from person to person.” For this reason, we’d recommend testing it in person rather than going for the blind buy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fragrance Family:</strong> Woody amber | <strong>Key Notes:</strong> Jasmine, cedar, saffron | <strong>Size: </strong>1.2 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-snif-house-of-8></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Snif House of 8</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Snif House of 8" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/EEAZNIyTHVSvp1qstlNwaNvWp7w=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Snif-House-of-8-a0056594b3324c1d9e3e91dab66ea400.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Snif</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This is a rare gourmand that can be worn by any gender.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>If you’re looking for something sweet, this might not appeal to you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Created in collaboration with YouTube creator Larray, this scent is <strong>inspired by the eighth house of astrology</strong>, which represents relationships, sex, and taboos. Indeed, this <strong>expensive-smelling yet affordable</strong> fragrance has sex appeal in spades, thanks to its unique blend of notes that’s sensual on <strong>any gender</strong>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A cocktail of <strong>dark chocolate and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>creamy vanilla notes</a> </strong>are balanced by herbaceous sage as well as powdery iris and feminine lavender. It’s this balance that makes it ideal for all, but if you’re the kind of perfume wearer that prefers to smell like the inside of a bakery, this one may not scratch the itch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Instead, reach for it if you’re looking for something more <strong>intimate and musky </strong>— it’s great for a night out.

However, the stars of this fragrance show are <strong>heady white florals</strong> — tuberose, gardenia, jasmine, and lily of the valley. It also has notes of <strong>juicy peach pulp</strong>, <strong>velvety sandalwood</strong>, and <strong>earthy vetiver</strong> for a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>luxury scent</a> that is remarkably sultry and striking, with a strong, enduring presence capable of making anyone feel like a femme fatale. It’s the <strong>maturity</strong> and audaciousness of this fragrance that makes it great, but be warned — that means it’s also not for the faint of heart. <strong>Wear this one with confidence and style.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The packaging is also chic, with a sleek black glass bottle (uncommon in perfume) with a subtle pop of pink on the label for a color combo that feels very much of its era without coming across as dated.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fragrance Family:</strong> White floral｜<strong>Key Notes:</strong> Jasmine, gardenia, musk｜<strong>Size: </strong>1.7 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-musk-le-labo-another-13-eau-de-parfum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Musk</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Le Labo ANOTHER 13 Eau de Parfum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Le Labo ANOTHER 13 Eau de Parfum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/9OUDP9TTjJKFA626osptzSZIEoc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Le-Labo-Another-13-Eau-de-Parfum-a2827886d2e643bfb5c7fb554c02a9de.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Saks Fifth Avenue</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This clean-smelling fragrance can be worn by anyone and everyone.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Because it’s a skin scent, some may be nose blind to it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another 13 is an exquisite example of what’s known as a molecular skin scent, meaning it features molecular structures that create a scent that’s odorless in the body, but transforms on the skin like a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>pheromone fragrance</a> to <strong>amplify your natural body chemistry</strong> with a clean, fresh, almost indescribable aroma that is bound to earn you many compliments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Be aware that some people have difficulty smelling this scent on themselves — don’t worry, you smell good. Le Labo also has the expert seal of approval: “Le Labo scents are great fragrances and a great value for the high quality of the fragrance,” says Dsm-firmenich perfumer, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Alexandra Monet</a>. “They invest a lot into ensuring the quality of fragrance is very high.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fragrance Family:</strong> Musk | <strong>Key Notes:</strong> Jasmine petals, moss, ambrette seed absolute | <strong>Size: </strong>1.7 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-floral-frdric-malle-carnal-flower-eau-de-parfum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Floral</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Frédéric Malle Carnal Flower</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Fr&amp;eacute;d&amp;eacute;ric Malle Carnal Flower Eau de Parfum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/aF3hZHS2DBcCRllm-Ko9M0SMwsg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nordstrom-frederic-malle-carnal-flower-parfum-spray-e3f583e01d6a40d589e43ec68740838b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This legendary and massively popular fragrance should be in any white floral lovers’ rotation.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>On some, the eucalyptus note can be overpowering.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The nose behind this scent, Dominique Ropion, is a master of the craft, and that’s clear upon first sniff. With tuberose leading the charge, the fragrance boasts a positively <strong>elegant mix</strong> of white florals as well as unexpected notes of melon, coconut, coconut, and eucalyptus, all resting on a base of musk. It projects and <strong>wears beautifully</strong>, with <strong>no need for spritzes throughout the day</strong>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Remember that perfume projects differently depending on who’s wearing it; while most people get creamy and almost animalic tuberose from Carnal Flower, some skin chemistry amplifies the camphor in the eucalyptus, which may not be your desired outcome. However, it’s that green aspect that makes this white floral more <strong>gender-neutral</strong> than most. We’d recommend testing this one before committing to a full-sized bottle to make sure it’s a fit for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fragrance Family:</strong> Floral<strong>｜Key Notes:</strong> Tuberose, jasmine, white musk｜<strong>Size: </strong>1.7 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-winter-krigler-oud-for-highness-75-eau-de-parfum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Winter</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Krigler Oud For Highness 75 Eau de Parfum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Krigler Oud For Highness 75 Eau de Parfum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/kNpeDr1hgtLW7NebiAO2AOBOn0w=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Krigler-Oud-For-Highness-75-Eau-de-Parfum-2f2f6fac7cd0430692c2a63336434cdd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Krigler</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This is the most luxurious oud we’ve ever had the pleasure of wearing.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>This fragrance is heady with a huge sillage, so it’s not a scent for all seasons.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With the price point to match, Oud For Highness is literally regal: It was formulated for King Hussein of Jordan in the mid-1970s. And while it may have been made for a man, it’s our <strong>seasonal go-to</strong> for when we want to feel like the powerful women we are. <strong>Warm, spicy, and elegant</strong> with notes of syrupy honey and indulgent oud (one of the rarest and priciest ingredients used when making perfumes), every spritz will make you feel more confident than the last. If you’re more of a wallflower, note that this <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>spicy scent</a> is <strong>bold</strong>, both in vibes and strength.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That said, if you feel you are someone who can wear this scent without it wearing you, we highly recommend reserving it for winter. It’s too potent in warm weather, but it stuns in the cooler seasons. Its <strong>longevity is so excellent</strong> that we look forward to smelling Oud For Highness on our dressier winter outerwear when we take it out of storage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fragrance Family:</strong> Spicy | <strong>Key Notes:</strong> Honey, saffron, oud | <strong>Size: </strong>1.7 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-woods-house-of-bo-espiritu-eau-de-parfum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Woods</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>House of Bo Espiritu Eau de Parfum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="House of Bo Espiritu Eau de Parfum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/dXR2ALGAV2GDaEP-hIbmzzBqw_4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/House-of-Bo-Espiritu-Eau-de-Parfum-fbdb5e18de204444b419e8633f09abc1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Saks Fifth Avenue</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The craftsmanship of this scent and its packaging are truly noteworthy.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The leather note in this one is strong, so you may want to reserve this perfume for cooler days.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">From the hand-carved cap to the <strong>innovative</strong> juice inside, you’ll instantly be captivated by this <strong>genderless</strong>, modern spin on a classic <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>woody scent</a>. “The <strong>packaging is absolutely stunning</strong>, and this scent is the hero scent of the House of Bo collection,” says Gray. “The leather, floral, and musk notes are absolutely incredible.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Mexican oakwood</strong>, which nods to the heritage of the brand, is the grounding element, supported by a generous dose of <strong>leather</strong>, which is enhanced by <strong>powdery iris</strong>, peach skin-like osmanthus, and earthy carrot skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In the best possible way, this <strong>luxury fragrance</strong> smells like a <strong>well-loved, high-quality leather handbag</strong> that’s long been a staple of your wardrobe; similarly, this perfume is also bound to become a go-to in your routine.

Just a spritz of this scent will envelop you in <strong>lush, velvety gardenia</strong> with fresh green notes, making you <strong>smell sophisticated, stylish, and a little bit sexy</strong>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-97 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fragrance Family</strong>: Floral<strong>｜Key Notes:</strong> Gardenia, green notes<strong>｜Size:</strong> 1.7 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-fruity-ellis-brooklyn-apple-love-eau-de-parfum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Fruity</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ellis Brooklyn Apple Love Eau de Parfum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ellis Brooklyn Apple Love Eau de Parfum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ThMnnToPYieqyQff4DG8mugArNc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ellis-brooklyn-apple-love--87ee9ae1b06f4b468ae18375edf88257.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This is an elevated take on a classic fruity fragrance.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>While the notes read as very sweet, a confection-loving gourmand aficionado may not think it smells that way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-100 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While you might associate<strong> fruity scents</strong> with teenage nostalgia, don’t get it twisted — this NYC-inspired perfume is a super<strong> sophisticated spin</strong> on apple that doesn’t smell like a body wash of yesteryear, but an <strong>elegant woman </strong>walking down cobblestone streets on a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>brisk fall day</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-101 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That’s due to the <strong>balance of notes</strong> here: Red apple, peach skin, and mandarin essence are quickly tempered by florals like osmanthus, plum blossom, and lily of the valley, as well as a light dose of sugar cane. It’s all grounded by sandalwood, vanilla, musks, and a caramel-like praline.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-102 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While these notes might imply a scent that skews sugarbomb, it’s actually anything but — the musks take this fragrance from being a standard gourmand to more of an amber scent. If you’re looking for a fragrance that’ll give you a cavity, this isn’t it, but if you want to <strong>smell chic and a little bit cheeky</strong>, give this one a sniff.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-103 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fragrance Family:</strong> Fruity floral | <strong>Key Notes:</strong> Red apple, osmanthus, praline | <strong>Size: </strong>1.7 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html" readability=14.5><li readability=21><strong>Rare Ingredients</strong>: There are a lot of factors that go into the price of a perfume, including its strength, performance, and structure, but the <strong>raw materials are the largest determinant</strong> in what can cause a fragrance to err on the costly side. Other times, says Monet, it's all about perception. "White florals, for example, tend to read more luxury than fruity scents."<p>Typically, though, it’s individual notes. “<strong>Oud</strong> is an ingredient that is <strong>extremely expensive</strong> because it comes from the agar tree, of which only about two percent actually produce oud, therefore making it very exclusive and rare," explains Gray. Interestingly enough, <strong>rose and jasmine</strong> are also pricey, because it takes a great deal of flowers to produce just a small amount of essential oil.</p><p>Perhaps the most expensive raw materials used in perfumery is <strong>orris root</strong> — and because it’s so costly, you’ll have a hard time finding it in most fragrances today. “The ingredient itself requires two to three years to yield the oil from its roots, resulting in a cost of around $80,000 per kilogram,” says Mauro. Orris is an iris root, and while it has a very distinct scent — it smells like a blend of violets, suede, and skin with powdery and woody notes.</p></li><li readability=8><strong>Fragrance Type</strong>: A variety of acronyms, mostly <strong>EDP and EDT</strong>, refer to eau de parfum and eau de toilette. You might also see the words “cologne” or “extrait.” All of these terms signify the concentration of the <strong>perfume oil </strong>in the bottle. “This should be considered when shopping for fragrance depending on <strong>how strong you want your fragrance to be</strong> and how long you want it to last,” says Gray.<p>Often, <strong>extraits and eau de parfums will be pricier</strong> than other formats of fragrance as they use more raw materials. However, that doesn’t mean one is necessarily better than the other.</p><p>“The forms of fragrance will really depend on the construction of the fragrance, so there are really no set rules,” says Mauro. Choose a scent by how you enjoy it or even the setting in which you wear it.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you find your signature scent?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Mauro recommends starting with a bit of research. “Begin by determining if you like fresh or warm fragrances, then consider when you want to wear it,” he says, while Gray recommends to just get out there and start spritzing. Ask yourself, she says, if it <strong>makes you happy, makes you feel like your authentic self, and giving you a boost of confidence</strong>?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s <strong>absolutely imperative</strong> that you actually apply the fragrance before coming to a final conclusion. “You need to wear the fragrance and <strong>try it on your skin</strong>, not just on a blotter,” insists Monet. “You need to be able to wear it and live with it for a few hours or a few days — this is when you will know you found your signature.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But<strong> don’t feel like you need to limit yourself </strong>to just one scent, says Mauro. “Be open to expanding your fragrance wardrobe to include a range of fragrance families,” he recommends. “Experiment with your fragrances and create your own signature combination.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How can you make perfume last longer?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Once you’ve made the investment in a long-lasting, luxury fragrance, you want to do everything you can to <strong>extend its longevity</strong>, both on your skin and in the bottle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For better wear, make sure you’re applying it correctly — and believe it or not, that starts with hydrated skin! “Perfume will last longer on skin that has been moisturized,” says Gray. “Start with a scented lotion for a fragrance layering experience or an unscented lotion to let your fragrance shine.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Then, consider how you spray it on. You’ll want to<strong> focus on pulse points</strong>, most commonly the inner wrists, but <strong>dab instead of rub</strong>. “Rubbing the pulse points too aggressively can cause friction and potentially change the intended character of the top notes,” says Mauro.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To make your scent <strong>last longer in the bottle</strong>, you’ll need to store it correctly, so if you’ve been keeping your perfume in the bathroom, consider this your warning. “Keep your bottle out of light and in cooler temperatures,” says Monet. The extreme fluctuations of a bathroom — varying levels of heat, light, and humidity — can quickly kill a bottle of fragrance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“The best thing is to keep them in the fridge if possible,” she adds.
