Most professional chefs and bakers would agree.

In the spirit of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Valentine's Day</a>, we asked six couples who are superstars in the food world to share the moment when they knew they had met their culinary match.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sue-torres-and-darren-carbone-of-el-vez></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Sue Torres and Darren Carbone of El Vez</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sue Torres was formerly the chef at Sueños in New York City; Darren Carbone is the executive chef at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>El Vez</a> in New York City.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sue:</strong> I asked Darren to cook his beef stew for my sister and I on a cold winter day. We went to the store together to buy the ingredients and, as we are going up and down the produce aisle, he put parsnips, rutabaga, celery root, and other ingredients in the cart. My sister is your basic carrot and potato kind of lady. Darren said that, even if she didn't eat the more off-the-beaten-path ingredients, she will when she tries his beef stew. Not only did she clean the whole bowl and have seconds, she claimed any leftovers for herself. In that moment, I knew that a guy who cooks with that much passion must be the right one for me.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Darren:</strong> At our first family gathering, Sue made eggplant parmesan. I was done; it was on another level. She used a batter instead of bread crumbs and sliced the eggplant very thin to maximize the batter. I am very lucky and grateful to have an incredible chef for a wife that fills my heart with love and my belly with soulful cooking.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-angie-rito-and-scott-tacinelli-of-don-angie></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Angie Rito and Scott Tacinelli of Don Angie</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ashley Sears</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Angie Rito and Scott Tacinelli are co-chefs at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Don Angie</a> in New York City.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Angie: </strong>Scott and I fell in love shortly after we met. We barely knew each other and decided to go on a backpacking trip through Spain. A dish from that trip that sticks out in each of our minds is a simple sandwich we ate in a small, local café in Grenada: jamón ibérico and manchego on a roll. It was perfect in its simplicity—the quality of the ingredients was unlike anything I'd had before. It was a moment that truly brought us together over our passion for food.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Scott: </strong>It was the perfect sandwich—the sharpness of the cheese and earthiness of the ham were a perfect balance of flavors on the fresh, soft roll and it didn't need the help of any condiments. We haven't tried to recreate it, because it was so specific to where we were at the time, in the same area where the meat, cheese, and bread were produced.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-jeni-britton-bauer-and-charly-bauer-of-jenis-splended-ice-creams></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Jeni Britton Bauer and Charly Bauer of Jeni's Splended Ice Creams</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jeni Britton Bauer is the owner of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams</a>; Charly Bauer is the director of stewardship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Jeni:</strong> I had brought some of my ice creams to a party in March 1999, and we met while I was conducting a tasting of them in the kitchen. I was late to the party, and Charly was wearing a bathrobe he had "borrowed" from the people who owned the house after a dip in the hot tub outside. It turns out that he had actually seen me earlier that day at the market. The rest is history.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Charly: </strong>I was shopping in Columbus's downtown market for something to make for a dinner party and I saw the most beautiful human being I had ever laid eyes on making ice cream behind the counter. I thought to myself that I was going to marry her someday. At the party later that night, she showed up and brought her amazing ice cream. Rumors about what I was wearing that night are just that.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sarah-schneider-and-demetri-makoulis-of-eggshop></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Sarah Schneider and Demetri Makoulis of Eggshop</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sarah Schneider and Demetri Makoulis are co-owners of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Eggshop</a> in New York City.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sarah: </strong>After a long night filled with too much champagne in the Hamptons, we grabbed egg sandwiches to cure our hangovers.

It was love.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Demetri: </strong>On weekends in the Hamptons, grilled lobster was always our go-to dinner.
