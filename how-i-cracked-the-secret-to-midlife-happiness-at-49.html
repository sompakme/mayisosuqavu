Turns out the youth don’t have the monopoly on happiness after all. A boon for us midlifers who were anticipating a slow decline into despondency and compression socks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a61d03b8194f-rosie-green-blue-dress.jpg><p id=ekA1UasFosZ data-wc=26>Oswald says the pattern is pretty universal across genders and continents and I fit it perfectly. Except I was a smidge early for my nadir moment.</p><p id=eweCJZOloQs data-wc=39>After an exultant twenties (as a stylist at a glossy fashion magazine - it was all Choos, canapés and taping up SJP’s boobs to ensure peak perkiness), I’ll admit to a gentle decline in joy over the following decade.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I'm 48 and I have never felt more alive" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/f0f599ede94f-donna-1.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I'm 48 and I have never felt more alive" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I'm 48 and I have never felt more alive</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=efU4Mr33cRr data-wc=31>My thirties were blessed with babies, but the work/life juggle was real. Still, I was ticking off all the milestones - marriage, children, countryside move - feeling exhausted, but vaguely smug.</p><p id=eA97-RdvnuB data-wc=53>Until, wham, 45 hit. That year my husband left me and my job ‘ceased to exist.’ All on one hideous January day. Now I was plummeting into a ravine of despair and when I hit the bottom of that U (okay, it was more like a V) I did so at high velocity.</p><p id=evmuovAw4h6 data-wc=41>It wasn’t pretty. But after throwing myself a pity party and spending too long in very unflattering athleisure wear, I decided I could either drown in my tears or strap on the crampons and climb up towards the chink of light.</p><p id=e0bScGxQnF data-wc=8><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>How I found myself again after divorce</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e2ezS0XjWjo data-wc=26>I chose the latter and friends, therapy and exercise propelled me forwards until one day I realised it was all getting exponentially better. Like really good.</p><p id=esYLOg5Fces data-wc=49>I encountered joys I hadn’t ever anticipated. The thrill of <a class=hm-link href=#>dating</a>. Then new love. A revived career (now I had a story worth writing about). And suddenly my children were capable of brushing their own teeth unsupervised, replacing loo rolls (occasionally) and were actually great to hang out with.</p><p id=ebe1XUc1qUC data-wc=23>I’m sure there will be more challenges to come, but for now Oswald is right, the direction of travel is most definitely upwards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/15073e650cb7-rosie-green-smiling.jpg><p id=e8ftFZLQaM- data-wc=14>I’ve realised that this happiness comes from experience, a new confidence and greater self-knowledge.</p><p id=ebZotBU6CHa data-wc=25>So, whether you are anticipating, entering, or emerging from your midpoint - how great is it to think your best days are ahead of you?</p><p id=eSSPgjhpqt9 data-wc=11><strong>INSPIRATION:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Sadie Frost's second act: 'I'm the best version of me'</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>My happiness manifesto</strong></h2><h3><strong>Know uncool is the new cool</strong></h3><p id=e3vEIrITGvJb data-wc=51>Anyone else remember being crippled with insecurity as a youth? Ditching that shocking pink outfit for the black one because it can’t be ridiculed. Now? Don’t care. Last month I showed Kate Moss my banana holder. I’m not sure why and she looked suitably horrified, but I didn’t care a jot.</p><h3><strong>Be realistic (mainly about love)&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=eWNza2wET4eW data-wc=40>Happiness guru Mo Gawdat says discontent germinates in the gap between expectation and reality. I was guilty of believing the movie version of life actually existed and feeling constantly hard done by when it didn’t materialise for me. No longer.</p><h3><strong>Don’t fear rejection</strong></h3><p id=eunT9qqD5tHm data-wc=41>It’s a primal instinct to try and swerve it (in caveman days your survival depended on being accepted by the group). But the truth it’s you can’t avoid it, so instead work on building resilience so you can brush it off.</p><p id=eVnyUGjuQ7ZD data-wc=14><strong>&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Visit HELLO!'s Second Act hub for inspiring stories of women living their best midlife.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfncKjv46snJynnpl6oq%2FTaGxqbGVsfnC%2FxJypnqxdoraluMifnGagkaW9qrrErKpmqp%2BotqZ5xqucnqZf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
