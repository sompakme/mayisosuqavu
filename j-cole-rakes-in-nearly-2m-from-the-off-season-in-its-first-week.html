Cole Rakes In Nearly $2M From 'The Off-Season' In Its First Week</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p><a href=# class=text-word rel>J. Cole</a> began the rollout <a href=# rel>of his highly-anticipated sixth studio album&nbsp;</a><a href=# rel>The Off-Season</a>&nbsp;way back in July of 2020 with its lead single "The Climb Back." He followed up with "Interlude"&nbsp;this month a week <a href=# rel>before debuting the project</a>. Proving to be another instant success for Cole, the project became his sixth consecutive number-one album in the country.</p><p>Additionally, he earned the largest streaming week of 2021,&nbsp;<a href=# rel>accumulating over 325.5 million streams while selling 282,000 album-equivalent units</a> in its first week. With such a colossal opening week, it's no surprise&nbsp;the North Carolina native&nbsp;earned nearly $2 million from song revenue after just one week.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/83/41/064183_a8d377212f1421fcd17af8e9901cb747.jpg><p>According to newly published chart revenue via&nbsp;Hip Hop Numbers,&nbsp;Cole collectively earned $1,727,000 from all of the song's on&nbsp;The Off-Season&nbsp;in its first week. "My Life," "Amari," "Pride is the Devil" and "95 South" lead the pack with revenues of $214k, $193k, $185k, and $180k respectively.&nbsp;</p><p>"Applying Pressure," "100 Mil'," "Interlude," "Let Go My Hand," "Punchin' the Clock," and "The Climb Back" each earned the Grammy winner over $100k each, while "Hunger on Hillside" and "Close" <a href=# rel>each raked in over $90k for Cole</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While these figures are nearly unheard of with most new musical releases, the chart success of each song on the album paints a clear image of how he was able to accomplish it. While four songs from the album debuted in the top ten region of the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;Hot 100 chart, each song on the album charted within the top forty.&nbsp;</p><p>To put it simply, <a href=# rel>J. Cole is unstoppable</a>.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdjaIR0g5ZmoWabn6Gybr7ApJysZZmjeq%2BxwKujsmWjZ7pustGopGasmJp6sLLFZqqemaOku261zWagratdm7azv9Nmrp6dm2K7psPS</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
