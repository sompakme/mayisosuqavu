Discovery streamer. The latter of those two seasons streamed in the spring of 2022.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Sources say Max had been considering a third season of The Flight Attendant but ultimately star and exec producer Cuoco opted against returning to the role.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Based on a novel by Chris Bohjalian, The Flight Attendant centers on Cassie (Cuoco), an alcoholic flight attendant drawn into a world of espionage when, in the first episode, she wakes to find a dead man in her hotel bed. The first season covered the events of the novel and was initially billed as a limited series. After becoming something of a breakout success for the fledgling, then-named HBO Max, the streamer <a href=#>ordered a second season</a>, which draws the character into another mystery as she moonlights as a CIA asset.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Cuoco earned two Emmy nominations for the role, and the series scored a nod for best comedy after its first season.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“What started out as an attention-grabbing book cover quickly evolved into an extraordinary flight of a lifetime,” Cuoco said in a statement.&nbsp;“I always envisioned TFA as a limited series and thanks to an incredible creative team, we were able to deliver two thrilling seasons. Personally, playing Cassie has been a dream come true and I am so grateful for everyone who played a part in bringing this extremely original series to life.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Added creator and executive producer Steve Yockey, “The Flight Attendant was a true passion project, and the reception from viewers and critics alike was pretty stunning. Our unorthodox spectacle of a show really found people. As we all move on to new projects, those two seasons of television and the incredible team of professionals behind them will always stay at the top of my list.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Both Cuoco and Yockey have kept busy with other projects since The Flight Attendant wrapped its now-final season. Cuoco stars in and executive produces Based on a True Story at Peacock, which scored a <a href=#>second season pickup</a> in October. She also voices Harley Quinn in Max’s animated series about the DC Comics antihero.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Yockey, who has an <a href=#>overall deal</a> at Flight Attendant producer Warner Bros. TV, developed and is co-showrunner (with Beth Schwartz) of the Max-turned-Netflix series Dead Boy Detectives. It’s scheduled to premiere later in the year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOpJilnalisLa7wqhkn6SZnLW1ecCtq56mlJa7tXnCmqWcnZyasW65wLFka2Wjmq60u82sZGpqY2qEen%2BVcW1o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
