She recently received a <a href=# rel>2x Platinum plaque for her smash hit album&nbsp;Over It</a>, which featured huge artists like <a href=# class=text-word rel>Usher</a>, PARTYNEXTDOOR, and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Bryson Tiller</a>. Last year, she <a href=# rel>tied a&nbsp;Billboard record</a> by having a whopping 18 songs on the Hot 100.</p><p>On Sunday, Summer paid tribute to the long road she's travelled. She posted two old pictures of herself on Instagram from back when she worked a cleaning business.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/37/62/536237_63bc2de67f9e5341ab5ac8401df1ebf5.jpg><p><h6>Derek White/Getty Images</h6></p><p>The pictures show her with cleaning supplies in hand. In the caption, Summer keeps her message simple, writing, "Don't give up." The massive R&B star worked as a cleaner from 2016 to 2018, while also occasionally stripping in Atlanta. She's a self-made musician,&nbsp;teaching herself guitar&nbsp;through YouTube tutorials.</p><p>This isn't to say everything's totally rosy for Walker now that she's famous. She's continued to have issues with her ex <a href=# class=text-word rel>London On Da Track</a>. She called him the&nbsp;<a href=# rel>"worst baby daddy on the face of the planet"</a>&nbsp;and threw the flowers he gave her for Mother's Day <a href=# rel>in the trash</a>. The industry, too, has been hard on her. She recently expressed her doubts about show business: "I'll be glad when we get back to a time where being 'real' can be honored & accepted again. Worshiping people who put on a picture perfect facade for clout when they really ain't got it like that or actually just ain't nice people makes me sick," she wrote in an Instagram story.</p><p>Check out Summer's pictures from her pre-fame days below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdkZn51f5Jmqq6lnZq%2FbsPApaKeql2otaK%2BxKxkoqajpbazrdOipqeZnGK9qbvTqKpmp5Zitaa%2B0p6jn2WRqHqiecKlnJqmlad6pbvNrWSgoaaaera8jKecsKs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
