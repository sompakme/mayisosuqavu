Although the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">song was mostly aimed at Drake,</a> there is no doubt that some of the bars in there were for Cole. This sparked a ton of reactions from fans. Mostly, the fans out there just wanted to hear some sort of response. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a> largely ducked the smoke. Overall, it has been three weeks, and he has still yet to actually deliver some sort of response. Meanwhile, fans have been curious about whether or not Cole would want to say anything. As it turns out, he did.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Earlier today, Cole dropped off a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">new surprise album called Might Delete Later</a>. The album is 12 tracks long, and is packed with features. The most important song, however, is the last one, titled "7 Minute Drill." In this track, Cole takes shots at Kendrick Lamar, and systematically goes through his discography. It even appears as though he calls To Pimp A Butterfly boring. Additionally, he calls Mr. Morale tragic. These are some interesting bars, and one has to wonder if Cole even believes them, or if he is peddling internet narratives.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-j-cole-speaks>J Cole Speaks</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I got a phone call that said somebody was dissing… Your first sh*t was classic, your last sh*t was tragic… your 2nd sh*t put n**gas to sleep but they gassed it… Your 3rd sh*t was massive hit that was your prime… I was trailing right behind but I just now hit mine," Cole raps on the song. Overall, these are the bars everyone is focused on, and for good reason. Now, all eyes are on Kendrick as fans wonder whether or not he will want to drop his rebuttal.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-the-song-in-question>The Song In Question</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of this diss track, in the comments section below.
