"I mean we never shook hands," she said. "The theory was that you couldn't shake hands with everybody, so don't start. So I kind of stick with that, but I notice others don't."</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p style=text-align:center id=e-5owp_5hTcb data-wc=16><strong>WATCH:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Princess Anne's last curtsy to the Queen as her coffin arrives at Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh</strong></p><p id=eL9Akr1SLstm data-wc=63>Referring to younger members of the royal family, Anne laughed: "It's not for me to say that it's wrong, but I think that the initial concept was that it was patently absurd to start shaking hands. And it seems to me that it's become a shaking hands exercise, rather than a walkabout, if you see what I mean. So that, it has changed."</p><p id=e6OHBvpOUZsl data-wc=1><strong>REVEALED:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Prince William and Kate play major role in first state visit of King Charles' reign - best photos</a></strong></p><p id=eCShTwvGYP0j data-wc=2><strong>FIND OUT:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Why Kate Middleton wore a blue sash to state banquet</a></strong></p><p id=eb43wVe7XieL data-wc=96>The mother-of-two added: "I'm glad I'm not starting now, because at least you had people to talk to, and now you don't really. Phones are bad enough, but the iPads, you can't even see their heads. You don't know who you're talking to. And I do get slightly, I either don't bother, or just say 'Look if you want to ask, you know, meet somebody, I suggest you put that down.' It is weird, as people don't believe that they've experienced the event unless they've taken photographs. And usually you're standing immediately in front of them."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7942ddb6d0bf-the-queen-princess-anne-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eoqa0AG1jD1F data-wc=8><strong>Princess Anne doesn't extend her hand to well-wishers</strong></p><p id=ef4yHLfuIlqY data-wc=42><strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Queen of the World was&nbsp;a two-part series</a></strong> that focused on Her Majesty's role on the international stage. In the preview, a narrator explained that the idea of a walkabout was first introduced in the seventies when the Queen decided to "shake things up" and "say hello to the crowds".</p><p id=egl9r2spzEn2 data-wc=59>Queen Elizabeth felt&nbsp;the same as her daughter when it came&nbsp;to technology overuse. In 2014, US ambassador Matthew Barzun revealed to Tatler that the <a class=hm-link href=#>Queen considered it bad manners</a> for wellwishers to be looking at a screen when she made public appearances. "She was essentially saying: 'I miss eye contact,'" Matthew said, adding that the monarch finds the selfie trend "disconcerting" and "strange".</p><p id=eT4zt3uJOSp6 data-wc=23></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
