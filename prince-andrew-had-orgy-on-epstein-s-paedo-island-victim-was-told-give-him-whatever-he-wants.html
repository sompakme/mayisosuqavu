openly bragging about celebs he would claim to know.</p><p>Another Andrew accuser <a href=#>Johanna Sjoberg</a> - who claimed the Prince groped her - also testified that Epstein told her Clinton "likes them young" when talking about girls.</p><p>One 2014 court filing listed on page 129 of the unsealed documents alleges that Maxwell "facilitated Prince Andrew’s acts of sexual abuse by acting as a ‘madame’ for Epstein".</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>It goes on to claim that Jane Doe 3, understood to be Giuffre, was kept as a sex slave by Epstein and was "forced to have sexual relations with this Prince when she was a minor in three separate geographical locations."</p><p><strong>It comes as...</strong></p><ul><li>More than 900 new pages of Epstein documents were revealed by a US judge</li><li>Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, Stephen Hawking and Michael Jackson were among 90 people named in the documents</li><li>More docs are expected to be released in the coming days -

but some of those involved in the trial were identified in the ruling through links to interviews they had previously given.</p><p>Judge Preska cited this as a reason for why their identities should not remain sealed.</p><p>She&nbsp;ruled there was no legal justification for continuing to conceal the names of more than 150 "John and Jane Does" mentioned in&nbsp;the&nbsp;court&nbsp;filings relating to Epstein.</p><p>Media sued to have the documents made public and they have been released on a rolling basis since 2019.</p><p>Wednesday's unsealing was the eighth release from the 2015 defamation case.</p><p>Giuffre sued Prince Andrew in 2021 for battery and infliction of emotional distress.</p><p><a href=#>They settled in February 2022</a>&nbsp;for a reported £10million, though he has always denied the allegations against him and claimed he could not recall ever meeting Giuffre.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Epstein killed himself in 2019&nbsp;while awaiting trial.</p><p>Maxwell, 62,&nbsp;is serving 20 years for&nbsp;<a href=#>sex trafficking</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/727-jet-playing-cards-cigar-552447535.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NINTCHDBPICT000514732958-1.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/5e74603f-ede8-48aa-8b75-9b4a816eaa39.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zZ6urGdhZX1xfo9vcGiemafAtXnNmqSeq12fsqey0Z6wZp2gqMGmtc1mqZ6klZbAprCMraadmalir7C5wayfnqScYrCwwdGtZKmZoJq%2FtHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX -
