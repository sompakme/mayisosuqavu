The show ran for seven seasons from 2009 to 2013. It followed the lives of families whoâ€™s children took part in beauty pageants.</p><p>When she was just three-years-old Kailia competed in her first pageant. Whereas in 2012 the whole world got to know her name as she became a meme from an image of her grinning widely.</p><p>The meme came about after the then-five-year-old Kailia was asked to share her favourite part of competing in pageants. She admitted: â€˜Cause I like to win moneeey.â€™</p><p>Throughout her childhood and early teens the youngster continued to take part in beauty pageants. She most recently competed for the Miss Washington Teen USA title in February 2022.
