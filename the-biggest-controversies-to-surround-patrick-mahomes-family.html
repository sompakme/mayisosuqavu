This would become the second time Jackson found himself in a spat with a Kansas City restaurant. Even more so, it would be another incident of alleged sexual assault for the TikToker.</p><p><a href=#>TMZ Sports</a>&nbsp;reported that the brother of the two-time Super Bowl champion was charged with three counts of aggravated sexual battery and one count of misdemeanor battery after he allegedly "forcibly kissed" Aspens Restaurant and Lounge owner Aspen Vaughn while dining at her establishment, which was apparently captured on a surveillance video. Jackson was also reportedly aggressive with a staff member. He was arrested that May and released on $100,000 bond. As of this writing,&nbsp;a preliminary hearing for the case is set for October 24.</p><p>Vaughn's restaurant permanently closed after the alleged incident became public. In an interview with <a href=#>The Kansas City Star</a>, Vaughn stated that a decline in sales, the establishment being vandalized, and not feeling safe were factors in closing the restaurant. During a <a href=#>press conference</a>&nbsp;that May, Patrick Mahomes was asked about the arrest and briefly addressed it by stating, "It's kind of a personal thing that I'm ... going to keep to myself. I mean, at the end of the day, I come here to play football and try to take care of my family at the same time."</p><p>If you or anyone you know has been a victim of sexual assault, help is available.
