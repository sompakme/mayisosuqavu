Bale won the best actor in a musical or comedy trophy for his portrayal of former Vice President Dick Cheney in the big-screen biopic Vice.&nbsp;</p><p>During his acceptance speech, Bale said he was cast by Adam McKay because they were searching for someone “who can be absolutely charisma-free and reviled by everybody.” Of playing the politician — who served as VP during George W. Bush’s presidency from 2000 until 2008 — Bale then&nbsp;<a href=#>thanked Satan</a> “for giving me inspiration.”</p><p>“It’s just a real insult to a guy who spent his whole life in public service, from secretary of defense, to chief of staff, to vice president of the United States,” said Kilmeade on&nbsp;Fox & Friends. “It makes Bush look terrible, Condoleezza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld, especially.”</p><p>After showing the clip, co-host Steve Doocy added, “There was Christian Bale being political [when] the show was otherwise politics free.” The segment ran with a backdrop that read, “Hollywood hate.”</p><p>Cheney’s daughter, Rep. Liz Cheney, had also taken to social media after the awards show to weigh in on Bale’s remark. “Satan probably inspired him to do this, too,” <a href=# rel=nofollow>she tweeted</a>, accompanied by a link to a&nbsp;story of the British actor getting arrested for assault in 2008.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the Church of Satan praised Bale’s shout-out: “To us, Satan is a symbol of pride, liberty and individualism, and it serves as an external metaphorical projection of our highest personal potential. As Mr. Bale’s own talent and skill won him the award, this is fitting. Hail Christian! Hail Satan!”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKe712adq6GVo7G0ecKhqaKrpJ6ur3nBmqOeq12ZtqS3jJyfnqaVrnq0rdOapWabn6K9or7IrKanZZmoeqK6jKKlrK2cqXpyfZZtZ3FqXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
