Fans are rooting hard for the new&nbsp;Bachelorette&nbsp;to find love...so, does she? If you're here because you're wondering if Michelle got engaged—or if you just crave spoilers in general—you're in the right place.</p><p>First, a refresher: Michelle came in second on Matt's season, later explaining that she was denied closure after Matt broke up with her on their final one-on-one date. "I had to walk away without closure, and I had to fill in the gaps of what our relationship really was," she told&nbsp;Matt at the&nbsp;After the Final Rose&nbsp;special early this year.</p><p>Announced as one of two&nbsp;Bachelorettes&nbsp;at the special,&nbsp;Michelle filmed her season between July and September this year (a schedule planned so that she could return for the new school year).

"It's like a fairy tale, which is different, I think...You guys will understand that word at the end." Of Nayte and Michelle's immediate connection, Tayshia said: 'There was just an unspoken chemistry there, which was really cool to watch.'"</p><p>As for Michelle's runner-up, that's a guy named Brandon Jones, per Reality Steve.
