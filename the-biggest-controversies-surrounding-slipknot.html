It wasn't because the band announced a headlining tour of the country, but for something far more harrowing. As per <a href=#>The Guardian</a>, 18-year-old Morne Harmse (pictured) — a student of Nic Diederichs Technical High School in Krugersdorp, a town about 20 miles west of Johannesburg — used a sword to attack and kill 16-year-old Jacques Pretorius on the school's premises. He also injured three other people in the process.</p><p dir=ltr>Reportedly, Harmse wore a mask reminiscent of <a href=#>the ones worn by Slipknot</a>. There have been conflicting accounts of which band member's mask it was inspired by, with some reports saying Joey Jordison's and others listing Corey Taylor's. Nonetheless, it brought the band's name into the fray — and, according to Harmse's friends, he was also a fan of Slipknot and their music. The school murder sent shockwaves throughout the country and world, bringing up the debate surrounding violent music and whether Slipknot holds any accountability for what happened. In a later statement, Taylor expressed his concern about the event, but insisted Slipknot's message has never been negative or about harm. Instead, he urged their fans to be united rather than hurt each other.</p><p dir=ltr>For his crimes, Harmse was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2009; however, he was released on parole in 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kXFpa2pnZK%2Bqs8aeqq1lk6S7tb7Or5yrq5mawG6%2F1KupqK2embavs4yso6Kom6O8tXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
