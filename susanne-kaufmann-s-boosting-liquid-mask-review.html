But there are many lifestyle and skincare swaps that can keep dryness at bay, such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>using a humidifier</a> in your bedroom and applying more emollient products on your face to lock in moisture to keep skin supple.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're looking for a quick fix that won't feel heavy on the skin and gets the job done in 15 minutes, though, look no further. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Susanne Kaufmann's Boosting Liquid Mask</a> is where it's at.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fueled by apple stem cells found sourced from Switzerland, this wash-off mask delivers both instant and long-term results (when used consistently). Formulated to provide deep hydration and plumper skin, the mask promotes the regeneration of new skin cells, which improves skin elasticity and makes it look both firmer and more toned.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The Swiss apple variety, Uttwiler Spätlauber is one of the most pioneering and exciting ingredients in skincare and is well-known for its ability to be stored for long periods without shrivelling and thus its longevity potential," says founder Susanne Kaufmann in a press release from the brand. "Rich in phytonutrients and proteins, the Boosting Liquid Mask plumps fine lines and wrinkles and provides long-lasting protection against the early signs of aging."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, apple stems cells aren't the only ingredients that make this product a must-try. It also includes hyaluronic acid to both bind moisture into the skin and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>red algae extract,</a> which neutralizes free radical damage and boosts skin elasticity.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Courtesy of Susanne Kaufmann</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$125; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>susannekaufmann.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The formula feels delicious on the skin, too. Unlike other hydrating face masks that can feel like you're applying a thick blob on your face, this one has a gel-like texture that feels cosmetically elegant and goes on the skin like silk. It stays put, too, so I never have to worry about it running down my face and into my eyes, lips, or neck. What I really love about it is how fresh my skin feels after applying it — energized, cleansed, and hydrated. A tip I got from Susanne when the product first launched was to use it before going on a walk to make the skin feel even more refreshed as you step out into the brisk morning air — and it's such a game-changer and staple part of my weekend routine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As if that weren't enough, the mask also comes in sustainable packaging. It's housed in a container made from recycled glass sourced from Germany (Susanne Kaufmann is based in Austria, so sourcing materials from nearby regions reduces its carbon footprint). The text on the bottle is also printed directly onto it using sustainable ink, which makes it easier to recycle and reduces waste. And when you receive it, it'll come packaged in recycled cardboard that's completely recyclable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A win for your face and the planet, if you ask me.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From non-toxic makeup and skincare to sustainability practices,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Clean Slate</a>&nbsp;is an exploration of all things in the green beauty space.
