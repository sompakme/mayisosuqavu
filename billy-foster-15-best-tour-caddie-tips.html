Here, he shares some of the insight he’s built up over nearly 40 years on tour...</p><p><strong>1. Work your strategy back from the pin</strong></p><p>You have to consider where the pin position is before you hit your tee shot. There’s no point hitting it down the right just because there’s more room there if from that side you can’t get anywhere near the flag with the second shot. If the pin is back right, you need to be hitting it down the left side of the fairway so you can leave yourself a better angle.</p><p><strong>2. All fairway bunkers are not the same</strong></p><p>The safe thing to do is, of course, lay back and take them all out of play, but there might be certain holes where you want to be aggressive because it is quite open beyond them. Always check the depths of the bunkers in the landing zones and make a note, saying: “If I go in there I’m chipping out” or “that one’s a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/tips/bunker-play-made-easy-242277>splash bunker</a> and I can get it on the green easily.”</p><p><strong>3. Know where you can’t afford to miss</strong></p><p>Tom Watson always said you win golf tournaments by limiting your mistakes. He won a lot of tournaments!</p><p><strong>4. Do you know how far you hit a 7-iron?</strong></p><p>When I was caddying for <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/tag/lee-westwood>Lee Westwood</a>, his 7-iron went 175 yards. Not 170-175, or 175-180, but 175. <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/videos/golf-swing-tips/what-are-your-cold-weather-yardages>You need to know to the yard how far you hit each club</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-" data-bordeaux-image-check></figure><p><strong>5. Be aware of your landing spot</strong></p><p>If you’ve got 180 yards in, but you then need to be eight yards short to give yourself the best putt, that changes the club you have to hit. Likewise, on a firm green your landing spot is not 180, it’s 165. It’s not about the total number, it’s about your landing spot.</p><p><strong>6. Don’t get wrapped up in technique before your round</strong></p><p>Do not go to the course with too many swing thoughts in your head because you will not play good golf. Hit a few shots, shape shots and get a feel for the swing before you play, but don’t get too technical. Playing golf swing is one of the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/features/10-reasons-you-arent-improving-at-golf>reasons you aren't improving.</a></p><p><strong>7. Work on your wedge game</strong></p><p>You may never be a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/tag/dustin-johnson>Dustin Johnson</a> or a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/tag/brooks-koepka>Brooks Koepka</a>, hitting it out of sight, but remember Luke Donald and Zach Johnson? One got to World No. 1 and the other won a Green Jacket and a Claret Jug. Why? Because their wedge play was outstanding. Spend more time working on your <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/features/the-game/how-many-wedges-should-i-carry-66059>wedge play</a> than anything else.</p><p><strong>8. Get your wedge distances dialled in</strong></p><p>For every single one of Fitzpatrick’s wedges, he has a shoulder to shoulder swing, a chest to chest swing and a chest to shoulder swing – each of them delivers a specific yardage. This enables him to become more consistent and, because the yardages overlap, he can then choose the shot he wants to play to suit the conditions, whether that’s a low shot that runs or a high one that stops.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-" data-bordeaux-image-check></figure><p><strong>9. All pros feel pressure</strong></p><p>However, the top guys have their gameplan and they don’t change their mind on the spur of the moment. If you have a gameplan, you are not going to be affected as much by the emotion of the situation. Sometimes you just need to take an extra 30 seconds to slow down the thought process. Take an extra breath and stick to your <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/tips/golf-pre-shot-routine-everything-you-need-to-know>pre-shot routine</a>.</p><p><strong>10. Know where the uphill putts are</strong></p><p>Nick Faldo once sent me out on a Sunday morning asking me to find where all the uphill putts were to each pin. His theory was that he would often ignore the flag and hit into the area that would leave him the easiest putt, which is always a straight uphill one. By doing that he’d be eliminating bogeys and double-bogeys.</p><p>Certain holes, yes, you can be aggressive, but on the hard pins you have to be disciplined to keep a double off the card. Play away from the flag and you still might make a birdie by holing a more straightforward 20-foot putt.</p><p><strong>11. Attitude and mental strength are huge parts of the game</strong></p><p>Bernhard Langer, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/features/the-game/things-you-didnt-know-about-ian-poulter-162455>Ian Poulter</a> and Graeme McDowell might not be the best ball-strikers to play the game, but as competitors, there have been few better. What they all have in common is great attitude. They are mentally strong, they plot the course they are playing meticulously and they have great short games.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-" data-bordeaux-image-check></figure><p><strong>12. When you next practise chipping, avoid too much loft</strong></p><p>The great champions – Ballesteros, Greg Norman and Langer in particular – <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/tips/10-tour-pro-chipping-tips-174399>used different clubs for chipping</a>. Don’t always try and land it close to the flag. Try and chip with a 7-iron, 8-iron, 9-iron or pitching wedge.</p><p><strong>13. Never hit a shot you are not 100% committed to</strong></p><p>If there is any doubt, it will find you.</p><p><strong>14. Use simple putting drills</strong></p><p>Any time <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/tag/tiger-woods>Tiger</a> plays a round, he throws down five balls, puts tee pegs in the ground to make a tight gate and putts one-handed through that gate. That’s to get it in the sweetspot every time – he does that every single day of his life.</p><p><strong>15. Let your attitude dictate your golf game and not your golf game dictate your attitude</strong></p><p>You’ve got to have a strong mental attitude and keep fighting, even if you make a double or a triple.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLvLn6SopqSdubp6wqikaKyZpcBwrsilo7JllqTAtbHRZmhuZaSevbR5xaumpmWknbJuwM6uqWZpaWl9d30%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
