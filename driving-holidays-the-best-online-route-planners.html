Years ago my father would order written routes – complete with directions and background information – from his motoring organisation. Is this still possible?</p><p><strong>David Williams, motoring expert, replies</strong><br>The Automobile Association started issuing bespoke route maps for members in 1912 because there were so few road signs. These were truly “personalised” itineraries with detailed information on local places of interest. The organisation was producing 250,00 such maps a year by 1999 but progress intervened and, although the service is still free, it is now automated and online, though you can print it out.</p><p>Called AA Route Planner (<a href=#>theaa.com</a>), the service is a highly effective, instant service in competition with other providers. The services vary to some extent. The trick is in how you use them.</p><p>The AA allows you to choose routes on or off motorways and you can add “vias”, or way points. It allows only four stop-offs so for your own tour you will have to work out your route in separate stages. It will help you find hotels and b&bs and the route appears both in note and map form.</p><p>The AA has a dedicated team of five out on the roads, updating maps and adding personal colour to instructions, such as “turn left at the Red Lion pub”. It’s a nice touch.</p><p>The RAC’s site (<a href=#>rac.co.uk/route-planner</a>) lets you choose between the “shortest” or “fastest” route and to add a generous 10 way points. You can also ask it to add a wealth of information such as locations of fuel and bus stations, restaurants, garden centres, post offices and golf courses, along with hotels.</p><p>My favourite for planning European tours is ViaMichelin (<a href=#>viamichelin.co.uk</a>), which also began by supplying bespoke, printed routes. Today, its website offers useful options which allow you to choose the most scenic route or the best route for motorcycles as well as the “most economical”. It can be tailored for cyclists and pedestrians.</p><p>Usefully – for instance for those contemplating French toll roads – ViaMichelin estimates the total journey cost, breaking it down into tolls and petrol and offering two optional routes. It spells out what proportion of your journey you will spend on motorways. Note, however, that you should click on the actual map once it appears, to get a decent view; it initially appears very cramped. You can also allow – or block – border crossings (useful if you don’t have the correct paperwork), congestion charging zones and tolls.</p><p>Another contender is a useful site by the satnav manufacturer,TomTom, which, like the AA, gives real-time traffic information (although this may change by the time you reach the location). Its website (<a href=#>routes.tomtom.com</a>) makes a virtue of allowing you to specify when you intend to travel, adjusting your route accordingly. It will steer you away from heavily congested routes at peak hours, drawing data from millions of TomTom users relaying information on their own journeys. As with most website route-finders you can click “return journey” to find the best way home.</p><p>Other sites include Googlemaps (<a href=#>maps.google.co.uk</a>) and Green Flag (<a href=#>greenflag.com</a>). The site you choose depends on which you are most comfortable with and on the options you wish to include. On major journeys it’s best to consult two or more; I recently drove from London to Innsbruck in Austria more than 24 hours and I found that the length of the route varied by hundreds of miles from provider to provider.</p><p>Despite the advent of satnav there is still high demand for websites which can instantly be accessed; it’s reassuring to have it on paper, too. No wonder the AA has produced 150,000 routes a day, most between 50 and 100 miles.</p><p>Written routes through the post are a thing of the past. But if you find an old one hang onto it; they are now collectors’ items and traded on eBay.</p><h3>Driving holidays in the US</h3><p><strong>Andy Sayner writes</strong><br>My wife and I are planning a self-drive holiday in the US National Parks and the Pacific Coast highway (some 2,700 miles). Should we book a 4x4 vehicle?</p><p><strong>Sophie Butler, consumer correspondent, replies</strong><br>With US car hire, you won't be insured to travel on unpaved roads but fly-drive specialist Bon Voyage (0800 316 0194; <a href=#>bon-voyage.co.uk</a>) suggests a 4x4 for the National Parks, swapping to a convertible in Las Vegas for the desert and Pacific Coast Highway.</p><h3>Driving to the south of France</h3><p><strong>Sophia Inskip writes</strong><br>In July, we are travelling to Pau as my husband is taking part in a French cycle race, but I don't like flying. Where should I get information on getting there, and on hotels?</p><p><strong>Sophie Butler replies</strong><br>For planning your travel by car or by train services look at uk.franceguide.com. For reasonably priced accommodation in the area, visit <a href=#>pau-pyrenees.com</a>, <a href=#>logishotels.com</a> or the equally useful <a href=#>chambresdhotesfrance.com</a>.</p><h3>Affordable honeymoon in Rome</h3><p><strong>Ann Knight writes</strong><br>We'd like to go to Rome and Venice for our honeymoon of 10 to 12 days in March next year. How can we maximise our budget of £2,000?</p><p><strong>Sophie Butler replies</strong><br>Find the cheapest flights on skyscanner.net. And, instead of a hotel, consider booking an apartment to save on eating out costs – rentals from £75 (Venice) and £91 (Rome) per night through <a href=#>ownersdirect.co.uk</a>. For travel between cities, look for rail offers on <a href=#>trenitalia.com</a>.</p><h3>Travel insurance for the terminally ill</h3><p><strong>Lara Agnew writes</strong><br>My husband has terminal cancer but currently feels well enough to travel. Could you suggest an insurer to contact?</p><p><strong>Sophie Butler replies</strong><br>I suggest you contact InsureCancer (01252 780190; <a href=#>insurecancer.com</a>), a specialist company which should be able to help you.</p><h3>Send us your queries</h3><p>If you have a travel query, we have an expert to answer it.
