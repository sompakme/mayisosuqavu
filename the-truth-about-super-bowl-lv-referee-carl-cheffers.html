In 2008, he received a promotion and became a referee (crew chief). "Carl has been extremely successful on the field as a side judge," said NFL officiating director Mike Pereira after the promotion, quoted by the <a href=#>American Football Database</a>. "He is very knowledgeable of the rules, a good rules guy. Strong presence."&nbsp;</p><p>In 2010, Cheffers faced some flack when he struggled to describe several fourth quarter penalties in a game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Houston Texans, according to <a href=#>Yahoo! Sports</a>. "To be clear, there were three fouls on the play, and they offset each other â€” unnecessary roughness calls against Dallas linebacker Leon Williams and Houston linebacker Kevin Bentley, and holding on Dallas long-snapper L.P. LaDoucer," wrote Doug Farrar in the article. "It's tough to keep that all straight in the heat of an important NFL game, so we'll give Cheffers a break on that one."</p><p>Other officials include Fred Bryan (umpire), <a href=#>Sarah Thomas</a> (down judge and the first woman to officiate a Super Bowl game), Rusty Baynes (line judge), James Coleman (field judge), Eugene Hall (side judge), Dino Paganelli (back judge) and Mike Wimmer (replay official). <a href=#>Super Bowl LV</a> occurs on February 7 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, FL, pitting the <a href=#>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> against the <a href=#>Kansas City Chiefs</a>.</p><p>Carl Cheffers, who wears No. 51, currently lives in Whittier, CA, with his wife, Nanette, and two children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2FkWtpcWlfqbWmedOrrK2gXZavsMHTZqquqJWneqO71qVkpa5dp7KnsdGenGabkae5bq%2FHnp2fnaKofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
