Don’t believe me? I have a weird thing behind my ear and I can feel it but I can’t see it in the mirror so I’ve tried to take pictures and I can’t! They’re all blurry! Sorry, back to the Livelys.</p><p>Over the weekend, Reynolds’ Hulu series Welcome to Wrexham, about his and Rob McElhenney’s attempts to revive football club Wrexham A.F.C., won a Creative Arts Emmy. Since the ceremony wasn’t televised, many stars opted not to attend, instead recording acceptance speeches from home, which is what Ryan and Rob did. But come on, it’s Ryan Reynolds. He couldn’t just say thank you, he had to be funny. And promote his next project, which is Deadpool 3. No shade, just saying, the man literally owns a <a href=#>marketing agency</a>, he is always gonna plug his stuff. So he accepted the award in character as Deadpool, referring to himself as 'Mr. Lively; and openly campaigning for a VFX Oscar. Strike’s over! It’s time to get these ads out!</p><p>On Instagram Stories, Reynolds revealed that for the video, in which he wears a corduroy suit, he was also in slippers, since: “fuck it. They won’t see below the waist.” In lieu of red carpet photos, he shared a shot of himself in an elevator (I think?), taken by his “Instagram boyfriend” <a href=#>Blake Lively</a>.</p><figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed"><span class="SpanWrapper-umhxW kGxnNB responsive-asset AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi eCxVQK asset-embed__responsive-asset"></span></figure><p>He also confessed that since he was recording the video before actually winning the Emmy, he didn’t have one to pose with, and borrowed friend and Deadpool 3 co-star Hugh Jackman’s, which the Wolverine won for hosting the Tonys.</p><figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed"><span class="SpanWrapper-umhxW kGxnNB responsive-asset AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi eCxVQK asset-embed__responsive-asset"></span></figure><p>It is broken. Look closely, and you can see that the sphere that the central figure holds up has come off, and Reynolds seems to have just slipped it onto her arm. Clever!</p><p>This article originally appeared on <a href=#>GLAMOUR US.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjApqauqp2WtKLGyKecZ5ufY8Kse8Crq6KbnJp8o7jApJxmpJmrsq3FjJyYpp2fYr%2B6rc1mqZ6xnqS5pb%2BMqZ%2BorJ8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
