Whether it is the crisp, zesty facet of lemon, the sweetness of oranges, or the tangy notes of grapefruits, they are refreshing, invigorating, and convey a sense of cleanliness," shares dsm-firmenich perfumer <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.instagram.com/erwan_raguenes/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Erwan Raguenes</a>.

Fragrance expert <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.instagram.com/a.dose.of.e/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Eudora Nwasike</a> adds that they can either energize and focus their wearer or send the mind's eye to a sunny day at the beach.</p><p>Ahead, some of the fragrance industry's most brilliant noses and editors break down everything you need to know about the best citrus perfumes. We'll dig into different notes, the history of citrus in perfumery, and (of course) the best citrus perfumes to pick up for yourself.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-to-look-for-in-a-citrus-perfume><span>What to Look For in a Citrus Perfume</span></h2><ul><li><strong>Notes: </strong>The citrus family includes notes like lemon, lime, orange, bergamot, grapefruit, tangerine, and clementine. "My favorite citrus notes are neroli, orange blossom, and citron. Fresh green Neroli and soft, honey-like orange blossoms are perhaps my bread and butter in perfume," says Huber. "Citron is also amazing because it’s a less familiar, yet very tart and refreshing note that brings a lot of green and has a lot of depth." The crisp, floral bergamot, meanwhile, adds an almost "water-like" quality to the fragrance with its volume, light, and energy.</li><li><strong>Wear: </strong>Nwasike says that citrus notes are naturally volatile, meaning they don't last long on the skin. "Hence the reason perfumers use them as a top note in fragrance," she adds. "Their fresh, invigorating scent captures your attention to prepare you for an exciting olfactory experience."</li><li><strong>Layering: </strong>Citrus layers well with a number of other fragrance families, including <a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-floral-fragrance/>floral notes</a>, woody notes like cedarwood, vetiver, oud, and sandalwood ("woody notes add depth and tenacity to volatile citrus notes, whilst the citrus notes cool intense woody notes to create a beautiful contrast" shares Nwasike), floral notes like jasmine and tuberose, and fruity notes like peach, mango, berry, and apple. "It's almost like you are drinking a chilled glass of juice," Nwasike adds.</li></ul><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-best-citrus-perfumes><span>The Best Citrus Perfumes</span></h2><a href=# data-model-name="Parfums de Marly Perseus Eau de Parfum" data-url=https://www.nordstrom.com/s/perseus-eau-de-parfum-nordstrom-exclusive/7739564 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/75786/1960196/23920?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk-prefix&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fperseus-eau-de-parfum-nordstrom-exclusive%2F7739564" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=nordstrom.com data-merchant-id=480139 data-merchant-url=nordstrom.com data-merchant-network=ImpactRad readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HHVNDz3cLPncTmqWte29Nb-1920-80.png><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">The Best Citrus Perfume Overall</span></p></a><p>Parfums de Marly Perseus Eau de Parfum</p><p>Perseus recently entered the Parfums de Marly assortment, and it's already a fan favorite—my boyfriend and my sister have both already stolen my bottle.

While all share a common freshness, these different notes offer perfumers a wide and engaging palette in their artistry. Here's a look at some of the most popular citrus notes, with information courtesy of the fragrance expert.</p><p><strong>Bergamot: </strong>Grown in Southern Italy, the perfumer-favorite bergamot fruit has a rich scent that's at once fresh, floral, and spicy. According to Nwasike, it's also popular in aromatherapy because of its calming and relaxing effects.</p><p><strong>Lemon:</strong> Sharp and acidic, lemon notes have a clean, energizing impact when included in fragrances.</p><p><strong>Grapefruit: </strong>Nwasike calls bold, juicy grapefruit the most bitter citrus note, adding that it's very volatile. Thus, it must be paired with other, more calming elements so that the resulting perfume isn't overpowering.</p><p><strong>Neroli:</strong> Neroli oil is produced by the bitter orange tree blossom. It has a sweet, spicy, and herbaceous fragrance profile.</p><p><strong>Mandarin: </strong>Sweeter than the humble orange, Nwasike says mandarin is "a mood booster that evokes the essence of sunshine."</p><p><strong>Petitgrain:</strong> Another product of the bitter orange tree (this time extracted from its leaves and green twigs), the herbaceous and slightly floral petitgrain is similar to neroli and can feel aromatic or green depending on what it's paired with.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HHVNDz3cLPncTmqWte29Nb-1920-80.png><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-pairing-citrus-perfumes><span>Pairing Citrus Perfumes</span></h2><p>As Huber mentioned, citrus notes are the well-fitting white T-shirts of the fragrance world. They go with just about anything.</p><p>"They can complement floral scents, creating a fresh and uplifting combination," adds Raguenes. "Citrus also harmonizes with aromatic notes like basil or mint, adding a dynamic and invigorating touch."</p><p>Woody and spicy elements such as cedar and ginger also play well with citrus, creating a "well-balanced and sophisticated" scent when layered.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-history-of-citrus-perfumes><span>The History of Citrus Perfumes</span></h2><p>Citrus has long been utilized in perfumery; historical records show it had a place in ancient civilizations like Egypt and Mesopotamia. During the Renaissance, citrus oils and extracts became even more widely used, and their popularity never died down.</p><p>And here's a fun fact, courtesy of Raguenes: Released in the early 1700s, the original Eau de Cologne by Farina belongs to the citrus family. "Emblematic of well-being and freshness, it was originally a personal hygiene product used on the body," he shares.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-meet-the-experts><span>Meet the Experts</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MP4UPW4i5nRpFtBpdZkiXb-1920-80.png><span class=person__name>Erwan Raguenes</span><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=INSTAGRAM><span class=button-social__icon></span></a>dsm-firmenich Perfumer<p>Perfumer Erwan Raguenes is a graduate of the Grasse Institute of Perfumery and University of Montpellier.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/emt5bfFo7K35egU49K2TTb-1920-80.png><span class=person__name>Carlos Huber</span><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=INSTAGRAM><span class=button-social__icon></span></a><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=WEBSITE><span class="button-social__icon button-social__icon-website"></span></a>Fragrance Developer and Founder of Arquiste<p>Carlos Huber first pursued the study of architecture and historic preservation at universities in Mexico City, Paris and New York City. A move to France, and then Spain, awakened his love for the aromatic environments of the Mediterranean and strengthened his interest in architectural history. This led him to New York City, where he graduated with honors in Historic Preservation at Columbia University. Huber’s experience in the world of luxury retail, creating meticulously detailed interiors for Polo Ralph Lauren, provided a unique opportunity to understand the world of luxury retail. Turning to his longtime love of perfumery, Huber studied fragrance development and collaborated with internationally recognized nose Rodrigo Flores-Roux to recapture the olfactive notes of historical moments. After conducting extensive academic research, Huber developed ARQUISTE Parfumeur.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uMB5mfC9vg4WE6QFMeUCRb-1920-80.png><span class=person__name>Eudora Nwasike</span><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=INSTAGRAM><span class=button-social__icon></span></a>Fragrance Specialist<p>Eudora is a fragrance specialist by the Fragrance Foundation UK, published journalist, and magazine contributor promoting and demystifying the art of fragrance across various audiences.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJqVlsK1xY6bnKysXZi2tb7UrGSfqpGcv6K6wp6qaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
