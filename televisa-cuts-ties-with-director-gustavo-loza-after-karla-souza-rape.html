We want to express our solidarity with Karla Souza and our goodwill disposition so that the legal process has the appropriate consequences. <span data-scayt_word=Televisa data-scaytid=9>Televisa</span> will not tolerate behavior like the one reported [Tuesday].”</p><p>Souza never mentioned anyone by name when she <a href=#>recounted her story</a> of a director who had visited her hotel room on repeated occasions during a one-month shoot and who had allegedly attacked and raped her one evening.</p><p>She said that after a month of dealing with the director’s “total abuse of power,” which included subjecting her to humiliation on the set, she finally gave in. “I ended up giving in to him [to let him] kiss me, to touch me in ways I did not want him to touch me and in one of those instances, he attacked me violently and yes, he raped me,” Souza told CNN while wiping away tears.</p><p><span data-scayt_word=Loza data-scaytid=13>Loza</span> <a href=# rel=nofollow>took to Twitter</a> to deny the <span data-scayt_word=Televisa data-scaytid=14>Televisa</span> accusation.</p><p>“I deny any accusation against me by <span data-scayt_word=Televisa data-scaytid=15>Televisa</span>, who has accused me without foundation regarding the case of the alleged rape reported by <span data-scayt_word=@KarlaSouza7 data-scaytid=19>@KarlaSouza7</span>, [one] I deeply regret and openly condemn,” he said.</p><p>In a statement sent to Mexican media outlets, <span data-scayt_word=Loza data-scaytid=20>Loza</span> called the <span data-scayt_word=Televisa data-scaytid=21>Televisa</span> accusation “irresponsible” because Souza never mentioned him in the televised interview. He urged Souza to publicly clear his name.</p><p>Souza, who currently plays Laurel Castillo in ABC’s popular <span data-scayt_word=Shondaland data-scaytid=24>Shondaland</span> drama&nbsp;How to Get Away With Murder, said the incident happened early in her career.</p><p>She previously worked alongside <span data-scayt_word=Loza data-scaytid=25>Loza</span> on 14 episodes of the <span data-scayt_word=Televisa data-scaytid=26>Televisa</span> comedy Los Heroes del Norte, which aired on the network in 2010. They also collaborated on the 2012 TV comedy La <span data-scayt_word=Clinica data-scaytid=29>Clinica</span> and the 2016 box-office hit Don’t Blame the Kid (Que Culpa <span data-scayt_word=Tiene data-scaytid=30>Tiene</span> el Nino).</p><p>Souza’s reps did not immediately reply to&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter‘s comment request.</p><p>As the #<span data-scayt_word=MeToo data-scaytid=31>MeToo</span>&nbsp;movement continues to spread throughout Hollywood, Mexican actresses <a href=# id=auto-tag_kate-del-castillo data-tag=kate-del-castillo>Kate del Castillo</a> (The Book of Life) and Stephanie <span data-scayt_word=Sigman data-scaytid=32>Sigman</span> (<span data-scayt_word=Spectre data-scaytid=33>Spectre</span>) have spoken out about sexual misconduct.
