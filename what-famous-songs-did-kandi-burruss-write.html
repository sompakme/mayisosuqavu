However, Burruss's biggest hit, by far, was TLC's "No Scrubs,"&nbsp;which was released in 1999. Per&nbsp;<a href=#>IMDb</a>, Burruss wrote the famous song with her Xscape bandmate Tameka "Tiny"&nbsp;Cottle and songwriter&nbsp;Kevin "She'kspere" Briggs. The song spent four consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts and went on to win two Grammy awards, per <a href=#>Song Facts</a>. Even over 20 years since its release, "No Scrubs" has remained an enduring favorite among fans, with "scrub"&nbsp;becoming a popular way to refer to a date that doesn't measure up.&nbsp;</p><p>TLC wasn't the only girl group Burruss wrote for. According to <a href=#>Atlanta Black Star</a>, she also co-wrote some of Destiny Child's earlier hits, including "Bills, Bills, Bills," "Bug-A-Boo,"&nbsp;and "Hey Ladies." The opportunity gave Burruss the honor of working with Beyoncé before her meteoric rise to fame.&nbsp;"She is the epitome of hard work,"&nbsp;Burruss shared with <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> in 2015. "I was blessed to be able to have worked with her early in her career." Burruss also worked with another big band — NSYNC — penning their&nbsp;2000 song, "It Makes Me Ill," per <a href=#>Bravo</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlibIN0go6wn5qsXZuurrvUrGSsp56cwG6wyJ1kpJmembZurtSrqa6ro2LEs7XTnmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
