But, life is all about balance. So while easy, breezy cuts and colors have been the status quo for the past few years, it’s due time for a little shake up—a pivot, if you will. As such, the 2023 hair trends are a little, well, extra. Think: More high-maintenance haircuts, dyes that require religious touch-ups, and glossy finishes that necessitate a stockpile of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/hair/hair-products-tools/>hair products</a> to “get the look.”</p><p>“2023 will be a big year for bold, vibrant, statement-making hair trends,” says celebrity hairstylist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://pros.dphue.com/pages/justin-anderson referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://dphue.pxf.io/c/221109/1090031/13921?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk-prefix&u=https%3A%2F%2Fpros.dphue.com%2Fpages%2Fjustin-anderson" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=dphue.com data-merchant-id=281726 data-merchant-url=dphue.com data-merchant-network=ImpactRad>Justin Anderson</a>. On the haircut front, pixies, bangs (yes, OG blunt bangs), and even <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/hair/g689/bob-hairstyles/>bobs</a> are making a major comeback. And when it comes to color? Gear up for more red (it’s the new neutral), icy blondes à la the Targaryans, and a sprinkle of cinnamon brown highlights that will transcend the typical warm-toned winter hue. In short, experimentation is the name of the game. Go big, go home! Get the chop! Take the risk! You get the point.</p><p>If you’re not sure where to start, please, scroll ahead. I tapped the best hairstylists in Hollywood to get the down low on the hair trends that will reign supreme in 2023.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-candle-lights><span>Candle Lights</span></h2><p>Think of candle lights as the beauty version of quiet luxury. It’s a warm, laid-back color technique that will look natural, fresh, and sophisticated on any skin tone. “These defined flickers of highlights are soft from the roots through the mid-lengths and then kick brighter toward the end,” says hairstylist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/sunniebrook/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Sunnie Brook</a>. “The candle light look is the new and refined version of a balayage, but with more separation and definition toward the ends.” It’s a relatively low-maintenance color technique that will effortlessly grow out from summer to fall. If you do end up needing a little pick-me-up midway through the season, just use a little purple shampoo, like <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.ulta.com/p/color-last-purple-shampoo-pimprod2005426?sku=2543694&cmpid=PS_Non!google!Product_Listing_Ads&utm_source=google&utm_medium=paidsearch&cagpspn=pla&CATCI=pla-1745784893020&CAAGID=108111962393&CAWELAID=330000200001747778&CATARGETID=330000200002750694&CADevice=c&gclid=Cj0KCQjwoK2mBhDzARIsADGbjeobQHJdUysYFBBJD2U0fK0rQ5K-CTCzkFjAnQJQxHgcV2JdVVTr8bkaAgYtEALw_wcB" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?sku=2543694&cmpid=PS_Non%21google%21Product_Listing_Ads&utm_source=google&utm_medium=paidsearch&cagpspn=pla&CATCI=pla-1745784893020&CAAGID=108111962393&CAWELAID=330000200001747778&CATARGETID=330000200002750694&CADevice=c&gclid=Cj0KCQjwoK2mBhDzARIsADGbjeobQHJdUysYFBBJD2U0fK0rQ5K-CTCzkFjAnQJQxHgcV2JdVVTr8bkaAgYtEALw_wcB&publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fcolor-last-purple-shampoo-pimprod2005426%3Fsku%3D2543694%26cmpid%3DPS_Non%21google%21Product_Listing_Ads%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dpaidsearch%26cagpspn%3Dpla%26CATCI%3Dpla-1745784893020%26CAAGID%3D108111962393%26CAWELAID%3D330000200001747778%26CATARGETID%3D330000200002750694%26CADevice%3Dc%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjwoK2mBhDzARIsADGbjeobQHJdUysYFBBJD2U0fK0rQ5K-CTCzkFjAnQJQxHgcV2JdVVTr8bkaAgYtEALw_wcB&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=ulta.com data-merchant-id=204095 data-merchant-url=ulta.com data-merchant-network=Generic>Biolage’s Color Last Purple Shampoo</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-choppy-curls><span>Choppy Curls</span></h2><p>“Like they say, history repeats itself. From wide-leg jeans, to platform shoes and funky prints, we’re seeing styles from the 70’s trending lately,” says Brook. “We’ll see a lot more big, bouncy, 70’s-inspired layered curls as we move into the cooler temperatures that allow for more control of your style throughout the day.” If you’re feeling the layered curl aesthetic, make sure you ask for layers that start at your cheekbones and open up and away from the face. “These will give your hair loads of lift, volume, and versatility.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-bold-layers><span>Bold Layers</span></h2><p>Choppy, layered cuts will be popular on curly hair—and on short 'dos. "I’ve seen an abundance of long layers and requests for the butterfly haircut, but I think we're going to see this shape on shorter hair cuts as well," says hairstylist and founder of a soon-to-launch brand called Basic Principle Jasmine Burnside explains. "More intentional shapes and textures are going to continue to have a moment because people want to feel glamorous and like their hair has a style and shape even when it's not blown out."&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-blunt-bob><span>Blunt Bob</span></h2><p>“We were so attached to overly textured hair for so long, in cut and in style, and I’m seeing a major resurgence of clean looks coming back,” says celebrity hairstylist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.a-frameagency.com/hair/clariss-rubenstein/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Clariss Rubenstein</a>. “The blunt bob is a clean, classic look. It has a heavy weight line at the perimeter and can be worn wavy or straight. It’s timeless and polished. The sleek bun is having a major moment, and this cut is sort of the short-haired girl’s answer.”</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

A shiny, polished blow dry, although a classic look, is very hot right now,” says Rubenstein. So grab your round brush and a shine-boosting product (she recommends the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://unitehair.com/products/u-oil referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Unite U Oil</a>), and go to town. You can add a few curls, do a half up situation with a hair bow, or even pop in some <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/hair/g35396374/best-hot-rollers/>rollers</a>. The actual style is totally your call—the trend here is all about the light-catching finish. As Anderson puts it: “There is nothing more gorgeous than the look of intensely shiny, reflective, healthy-looking hair.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-bold-bright-blondes><span>Bold, Bright Blondes</span></h2><p>When Anderson, who is responsible for blondes like Kristin Cavallari and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/gwyneth-paltrow/>Gwyneth Paltrow</a>, and celebrity hairstylist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.jennaperryhair.com/jenna referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Jenna Perry</a>, whose clients include Jennifer Lawrence and Bella Hadid, say there’s a new blonde trend—you listen. “2023 will be the year of bold platinum hues. Think old school Hollywood blonde with a modern twist,” says Anderson. Perry, for her part, predicts winter blonde, aka Targaryen blonde a la House of Dragons, will take center stage. “It’s the lightest <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/hair/g2607/blonde-hair-dictionary/>shade of blonde</a> that there is,” she adds.&nbsp;</p><p>While this is a high-impact color, keeping your blonde bright and your roots to a minimum takes work. You will likely need regular touch-ups and toning sessions, but a solid at-home maintenance routine is equally as important.

This will be your secret weapon to keep your blonde in its brightest state.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-dramatic-chops><span>Dramatic Chops</span></h2><p>Ok, hear me out: This next trend isn’t so much a trend. It’s more of a you-do-you approach to haircuts. “We haven't seen a major 'haircut' moment in a while, but 2023 is the year for statement making styles,” says Anderson. The options run the gamut, but commitment to a vibe is key. You could opt to go sleek and sophisticated with a bob (peep the above) or go all-in on a pixie cut. If it makes a statement, it's a go.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-shades-of-brunette><span>Shades of Brunette</span></h2><p>Being brunette was never out, it’s just really in at the moment. And the shade options are endless. Perry predicts a light brown cinnamon shade that resembles “the color of a teddy bear” will top the trends. Anderson’s brunette affection falls on the other end of the spectrum. “Rich, deep chocolate brunette colors will be coming back in full force. Vibrant, warm tones look stunning on so many people and mix well with caramel or honey hues for some added dimension.” Rubenstein, however, wants justice for the shades that fall smack in the middle. “I love that medium brown is being embraced. For so long us girls with medium brown hair felt like we had to go lighter or darker. Turns out, medium brown is perfect just the way it is. Maybe add a touch of gloss just for shine. Thank you, Hailey Bieber,” she jokes.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless of where you land, you’ll need a decent mix of hair masks and blue shampoos to keep your tone in tact.

She recommends using a hydrating shampoo and conditioner, like the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.amazon.com/Nexxus-Ultralight-Conditioner-Weightless-Treatment/dp/B09MZLZW17__;!!N96JrnIq8IfO5w!j6HcrwiO1jAYfdoDKTHqxKbwcCaeybQYlUxf7G3cpLAENkKEuc8qI4U4HJm66ZsQ23XN9EGISruO5wdXejVyFAL5mQ%24 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Nexxus Ultralight Smooth Shampoo and Conditioner</u></a>, that gives a silky effect as a first step.

Just remember: “Do not use crease clips if you want to keep the sides flat and smooth.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-bangs-baby><span>Bangs, Baby</span></h2><p>“I don’t want to call it a trend because I feel it’s a hairstyle that will always find a place in any hair conversation—bangs are here to stay,” emphasizes Redway. But the bangs we’re going to see in 2023 will have a 1990s or 1970s twist. “We’ll see really short ones, choppy ones, or edgy ones. We’ll also see versions of bangs combined with our other trends, like the red or auburn hair color, which is a bold way to debut your new look.” Rubenstein is on board with the whole bang situation, predicting a rise in curly fringe. “Whether you’re wavy or curly, it’s super cute and gives a 70s throwback vibe.” Just grab a great curl cream (Rubenstein recommends the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.ulta.com/p/curl-defining-cream-pimprod2018235?sku=2565572&cmpid=PS_Non!google!Product_Listing_Ads&cagpspn=pla&CATCI=pla-1217697764866&CAAGID=123358105809&CAWELAID=330000200002458930&CATARGETID=330000200002751454&CADevice=c&gclid=CjwKCAiAnZCdBhBmEiwA8nDQxUqR-SgO7EOvCqyzPk1RO8BJfwawF6XDIO2hMPrs6G3tTsoYv588ShoCVAIQAvD_BwE" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?sku=2565572&cmpid=PS_Non%21google%21Product_Listing_Ads&cagpspn=pla&CATCI=pla-1217697764866&CAAGID=123358105809&CAWELAID=330000200002458930&CATARGETID=330000200002751454&CADevice=c&gclid=CjwKCAiAnZCdBhBmEiwA8nDQxUqR-SgO7EOvCqyzPk1RO8BJfwawF6XDIO2hMPrs6G3tTsoYv588ShoCVAIQAvD_BwE&publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fcurl-defining-cream-pimprod2018235%3Fsku%3D2565572%26cmpid%3DPS_Non%21google%21Product_Listing_Ads%26cagpspn%3Dpla%26CATCI%3Dpla-1217697764866%26CAAGID%3D123358105809%26CAWELAID%3D330000200002458930%26CATARGETID%3D330000200002751454%26CADevice%3Dc%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAnZCdBhBmEiwA8nDQxUqR-SgO7EOvCqyzPk1RO8BJfwawF6XDIO2hMPrs6G3tTsoYv588ShoCVAIQAvD_BwE&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=ulta.com data-merchant-id=204095 data-merchant-url=ulta.com data-merchant-network=Generic>Bumble & Bumble Curl Cream</a>) and you’ll be set.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-finger-waves><span>Finger Waves</span></h2><p>Let's say you decided to get one of the statement, grungy haircuts we talked about above. It’s very cool as is, but there’s a way to up the ante even more. How, you ask? Via retro-inspired finger waves. “They’ll make an appearance with different haircuts,” says Redway. “We could even see the inspiration of finger waves making appearances with mullets and pixies.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-mid-length-mane><span>Mid-Length Mane</span></h2><p>If you’ve been waiting for a sign to bid your <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/news/g3668/different-types-of-split-ends-and-what-they-mean/>split ends</a> ado (let’s be honest: a two inch dusting does next to nothing), then listen up. Midi cuts are having a moment. “It can be anywhere between the collar bone and the armpit, be very layered, or have one length—it’s super versatile,” says Rubinstein. “You can shed your super long hair while still having the ability to put it all the way up.” Your styling options remain endless; you can go sleek and straight, add some waves, or even go for a more textured, natural vibe.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-meet-the-experts><span>Meet the Experts</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg><p><span class=person__name>Sunnie Brook</span></p>Celebrity Hair Stylist<p>Known for her creativity and passion for serving others, Sunnie Brook has been at the forefront of the beauty industry for over 20 years.
