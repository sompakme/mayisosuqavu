Security guards and airport staff kept an eye out for intruders or hecklers, making sure that no one would be able to bother them. It's unclear where they're going or where they've been, but the couple is keeping things pretty low-key these days compared to their other 2024 exploits.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, Kanye West still hasn't released his VULTURES sequels, and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">new recent studio footage</a> with Young Moose might indicate that this could change soon. But it's a Ye rollout, so we'd honestly not be surprised if the second and third installments of the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ty Dolla $ign</a> collaborative series end up being like So Help Me God, Good A** Job, and other mythical releases. Maybe the couple will just chill out for the rest of the year and enjoy themselves. After all, VULTURES 1 already got a lot of revenue, hype, streams, and acclaim, one that could definitely carry itself all the way through 2024.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-bianca-censori-amp-kanye-west-spotted-in-los-angeles>Bianca Censori & Kanye West Spotted In Los Angeles</h2></span><p>LOS ANGELES, CA - MAY 25: Kanye West and Bianca Censori are seen leaving the Chateau Marmont on May 25, 2024 in Los Angeles, California.

For example, Bianca Censori recently went on a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">solo Australian trip</a> to meet with her family, and it seems like they just hung out casually without much spectacle. It must feel quite different to the onslaught of paparazzi, fans, and the like that badger Kanye West and Bianca all over the world, but particularly in the United States. As such, a break every once in a while must be pretty satisfying.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Elsewhere, it seems like the case of <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">alleged sexual assault</a> concerning Bianca Censori and Kanye West attacking her alleged assaulter is still in limbo. Of course, Ye has much bigger fish to fry in this regard now. We'll see whether accusations against him end up manifesting in a big court case or if they resolve that matter of accountability privately. Hopefully the outcome is one of justice.

Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output.

As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C.
