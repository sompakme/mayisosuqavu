Really well. And we owe it all to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Fifty Shades of Grey</a> costume designer Mark Bridges (and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Jamie Dornan</a>'s physique, of course) for bringing that vision to the big screen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bridges took it upon himself to design all the suits, having them tailored to Dornan's measurements. "Christian is a millionaire," Bridges explains to InStyle on the decision to custom-make Dornan's costumes, "and someone like him would have a personal tailor." Crafted from light Italian wool, each suit boasts a modern body-conscious (read: sexy) silhouette with a slim cut that "hopefully, women will find attractive and men will want to emulate." But other than making Dornan look incredibly dashing, the suits actually play a much bigger, albeit subtle, role.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The goal was to outwardly give examples of how [Christian] is changing, softening, and becoming a 'real' person," Bridges says. "I don't think it's terribly obvious, but hopefully it's there and you feel it. It's an exterior shell to what's going on emotionally."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">How does he do that exactly?

I tried to mix things up with textures, patterns, and shades of gray. Christian is very forbidding in the beginning, but as the story progresses, he becomes a regular guy, or well, the closest thing to a regular guy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>His Navy Suit</strong></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I put him in this rich navy suit. Blue is still cold, but it isn't as chilling as gray.
