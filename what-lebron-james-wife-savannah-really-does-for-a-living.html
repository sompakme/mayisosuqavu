Throughout the years, Savannah has been involved in different business ventures. In 2010, she and LeBron launched a youth furniture collection in partnership with Ohio's&nbsp;American Signature Inc., according to&nbsp;<a href=#>WOIO</a>. But she branched out on her own, too.</p><p>In 2013, Savannah opened The Juice Spot in Miami. "I would listen to him talk about his conversations with Warren Buffett or Jerry Jones," she told <a href=#>ESPN</a>. "But I wanted to get into business, too."&nbsp;She had to close it in 2016 because she was having a hard time managing from afar following LeBron's departure from Miami Heat, the <a href=#>Miami Herald</a> noted.&nbsp;But she was far from done.&nbsp;In 2018, Savannah co-launched K+ Organics, a brand of sports drinks for children. "In this day and age, there are so many more healthy alternatives for adults than we had ... growing up, but it's frustrating to still not see healthier options for kids," she told <a href=#>Forbes</a>.</p><p>Savannah also has stakes in Lobos Tequila, Lockerverse, a Web3 startup, and NEZ, a natural deodorant company, she told The Cut. That's not all. Savannah is working on several projects that she's pretty proud of. "Definitely have some passion projects I'm working on ...&nbsp;And I'm super-excited about them. I think they're going to be amazing. They're going to be well received," she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtkaoR6hI6lnJuqn6N6q63Mnqpmr5mbsm6%2FwK%2BYp6aRnXqru8Fo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
