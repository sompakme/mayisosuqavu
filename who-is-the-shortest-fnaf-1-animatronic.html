She is a human character, who is wearing a costume.<h2>Who is the tallest in FNAF Security Breach?</h2>Although standing at seven feet tall would make Sundrop one of the tallest animatronics in the game, he'd still be several feet shorter than FNAF's tallest character, NightMarionne, who allegedly stands at a colossal 10 feet tall.<h2>How tall are the Funtimes?</h2>Funtime Freddy stands at a height of 6.0 ft, or 182 cm tall and weighs 350 lbs or 159 kg.<h2>How tall is Funtime Foxy?</h2>Funtime Foxy, being the shortest main animatronic in FNaF: Sister Location, stands at a height of 5.9 ft (Close to Funtime Freddy) and weighs 290 lbs.<h2>How many teeth does Nightmare BB have?</h2>Nightmare Balloon Boy (According to Dawko) has 171.7 teeth.<h2>Who is the scariest FNAF character?</h2>Withered Bonnie<p>Creator of the franchise, Scott Cawthon, considers Bonnie to be the scariest animatronic in the game and has said he's even had multiple nightmares surrounding the rabbit.</p><h2>Who is the fastest animatronic in FNAF?</h2>Currently, the fastest robot/animatronic in the world is the Cheetah robot, running at speeds of 28.3 miles per hour.<h2>Who is the smartest animatronic in FNAF?</h2>Personality and Behavior.

He is a blue animatronic rabbit with a red bowtie.<h2>Is Ennard a girl?</h2>In Ultimate Custom Night, Ennard is referred to with male pronouns, implying that it is male. However, due to fact that every Funtime animatronic has their own gender, Ennard possibly is both male or female, or doesn't have a gender at all.<h2>Who Possesss Ballora?</h2>Ballora is one of two animatronics to be more aware of her surroundings and not seem to rely on pre-recorded lines like the more rudimentary animatronics. The other is Circus Baby after she is possessed by The Daughter.<h2>Who is Ennard possessed by?</h2>Ennard is an endoskeleton, containing most of the animatronics from Sister Location within him after Night 5. Due to including Circus Baby, Ennard was mostly controlled by Baby/Elizabeth Afton.<h2>What is the shortest FNAF character?</h2>So what I'm saying is BB, Marionette, Mangle, Withered Golden Freddy, Withered foxy, are the same height, I'd honestly say the minireenas are the smallest out of all the fnaf characters, BonBon and Bonnet coming to a very close but not so close second.<h2>How tall is Ennard from FNAF?</h2>Ennard stands at around 6'02".<h2>How many teeth does Springtrap?</h2>Springtrap only has 2 teeth rather than having 6 like the FNAF 3 Springtrap.<h2>What is the deadliest animatronic in FNAF?</h2>Springtrap is one of the most aggressive characters in the series, Golden Freddy can teleport and turn into Golden Heady, and the Marionette was able to give life to most every animatronic in the series.<h2>How tall is Sundrop FNAF in CM?</h2>The Sundrop is the daycare assistant who has an 'alter ego' of the Moon.
