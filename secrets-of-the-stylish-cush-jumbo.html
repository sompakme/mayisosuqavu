Whether she's on-stage performing in Macbeth or filming long days for the hit Apple TV+ thriller Criminal Record, she's become adept at managing a full schedule. As a result, she has become acutely aware of the importance of self-care and prioritising skincare – a lesson she learned later in life. "I didn't wear moisturiser until my late teens," she tells us. "I think way more about skincare and beauty than I used to." We're talking from her suite at the London Edition, where she's preparing to attend a party thrown by the beauty brand Hourglass, in celebration of its new lip collection.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Cush Jumbo at the 2023 BAFTA Television Awards" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/gettyimages-1490102511-656f22f7aa4c6.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">These days, she says, her beauty philosophy is all about hydration and nourishing herself from the inside out. "You can be dressed up to the nines and still not feel very good about yourself," she explains. So when does she feel her best? "When my son tells me I do, which can be when I'm making pancakes in my pyjamas. He'll just turn to me and say, 'You look beautiful today Mummy'. Those are the moments you remember."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Here, Jumbo chats to Bazaar about her evolving relationship with beauty and style, her skincare priorities and why fashion is anything but frivolous.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">How has your relationship with beauty changed over the years?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I'm 38 now, so I'm approaching that middle stage of my life where I think about skincare and beauty more than ever. I didn't wear moisturiser until my late teens! Quality skin care for younger people wasn't as available when I was younger. I'm also definitely less concerned about how 'beautiful' people think I am – now I'm more concerned about how I really feel."</p><img alt="cush jumbo" title="Cush Jumbo" width=3481 height=5221 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/cush-jumbo-nikita-hourglass-lip-launch-030-jpg-65cdf438cfcb8.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Dave Benett</span><p>Cush Jumbo getting ready in her suite at the London Edition</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">Are you experimental with makeup?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I have strong facial features – I'm half Nigerian and half English – so I have big eyes and a strong jaw.

I also love the brand's new glossy lipstick, which is super moisturising – a nude or pink lip makes me feel on top of the world.

It means wearing make-up for a very long time. You don't always have time to remove that make-up and replace it, so you have to make sure the base of your face is as clean as possible at the start of the day, and that you do a deep clean when you get home. I always make sure my skin is clean and hydrated when shooting for long hours both outside and inside, otherwise, you'll lose all the moisture."</p><img alt="london, england february 13 attends the launch of the new lip collection from hourglass cosmetics at nikita on february 13, 2024 in london, england photo credit dave benett" title="Hourglass Cosmetics Lip Launch" width=2903 height=4354 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/nikita-hourglass-lip-launch-002-jpg-65ce430847d64.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Dave Benett</span></p><img alt="cush jumbo" title="Cush Jumbo" width=3206 height=4819 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/cush-jumbo-nikita-hourglass-lip-launch-046-jpg-65cdf43a43e92.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Dave Benett</span></p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">What is your most useful beauty hack?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Flannels! Whenever you go for a facial, [the therapist] will often use a hot muslin cloth on your skin, but I don't think many people think to use them at home. They're pretty cheap and sustainable as they can be rewashed – make sure you have a stack of 10 to 15 flannels in your bathroom, so you can use a clean one every day. I use a cleanser or melting balm and make the flannel nice and hot to wipe it off; it gives you a better clean than a make-up wipe or cotton pad. It makes a difference."</p><img alt="cush jumbo" title="Cush Jumbo" width=4763 height=3175 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/cush-jumbo-nikita-hourglass-lip-launch-008-jpg-65cdf43948f34.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Dave Benett</span></p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">What kind of fashion makes you feel your most confident?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I'm a combination of tomboy and all-out glamour, which is a crazy mix! I'm such a fan of Erdem, for its androgynous lines and sparkly pieces that make them quite feminine. It feels like you're going into someone's wardrobe and playing dress up; that's essentially why I love getting dressed up, as you can be somebody else."</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">How has your style evolved over the years?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"My style isn't actually that different from the days when I'd wear a tracksuit to class, then change into my girly ballet tutu when I get there. If I'm travelling to set or rehearsing I'm always in a tracksuit, whereas on the red carpet, I go glitzy and girly. That's pretty much still me going to a dance class when I was 11, so nothing has changed."<br></p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">What has been your most memorable fashion moment in recent years and why?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"For the opening night of Josephine and I in New York, I had a gown specially made by Giambattista Valli, with the help of Anna Wintour. He made the tulle from scratch in Paris and sent it over – it was the most amazing black fishtail gown. There's only one of it in the world and it's the most incredible thing I've ever worn."</p><img alt="cush jumbo" title="Cush Jumbo" width=3335 height=5002 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/cush-jumbo-nikita-hourglass-lip-launch-010-jpg-65cdf43a3836e.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Dave Benett</span></p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">Whose style have you always admired and why?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I'm a big fan of the classics, like Audrey Hepburn and Josephine Baker. I love performers and artists from between the 1920s and 1950s. I also love people like Tilda Swinton who have this effortless kind of femininity, but also it's very classic and slightly tomboyish.

I remember when I was a kid, my mother took me to the theatre and I was so enamoured by what I saw on stage. I went home and got an old shower curtain she was throwing out and made it into a wedding dress. Fashion ignites the imagination, especially for children, which is so important as you take that into your future."</p><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSzor%2FHoqanZZ6axLR7wG1tcHBmZ39ye9KemqudpKh6sLKMrZ%2BeZaOpxq210qFknK2jnXqrwcybpmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
