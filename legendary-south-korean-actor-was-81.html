For all the times and places, never was there a country [in] that both film industry and art are so dependent on one person. Without understanding Shin Seong-il, it is hard to get a grasp of either Korean film history or Korean modern cultural history.”</p><p align=left>Indeed, in 1967 alone, Shin appeared in 51 films that opened in local cinemas, and&nbsp;he starred in 324, or about 27 percent, of the 1,194 films that showed in Korea over eight years between 1964 and 1971.</p><p align=left>Shin (née Kang Shin-young) was born in Daegu, South Korea, on May 8, 1937. Having spent a rather ordinary childhood, the actor shot to immediate stardom through his debut piece A Romantic Papa (1960). During the Golden Age of Korean cinema, which spanned from the 1960s to 1970s, he enjoyed immense popularity as the country’s top leading man. The film Only for You (1962) played a crucial role in allowing Shin to rise to further stardom, while The Barefooted Young (1964) solidified his reputation as an “icon of youth.”</p><p align=left>He also starred in Shin Sang-ok’s&nbsp;The Eunuch (1968), which was invited to the Berlin <a href=# id=auto-tag_international data-tag=international>International</a> Film Festival, and established himself as a more serious actor through acclaimed performances in films such as Im Kwon-taek’s Kilsodeum (1986). Last year, the Busan International Film Festival, <a href=# id=auto-tag_asia data-tag=asia>Asia</a>‘s largest cinema event, presented a retrospective in Shin’s honor.</p><p align=left>In 1964, Shin married actress Um Aeng-ran, which until this day is recognized as a nationwide event. The two were virtually the local equivalent of “Brangelina” in their glory days. Shin and Um never divorced, but lived separately for a good part of their marriage; Um nevertheless is known to have stayed by his side in his battle against cancer.</p><p align=left>Shin’s death has saddened many in the Korean film industry, especially since he was known to have signed up for a role in Sohwakhaeong (working title). Slated to go into production next year, Lee Jang-ho is set to direct the pic. “I spent my childhood with [Shin] and we worked in the industry together after I became an adult,” actor Ahn Sung-ki told reporters Sunday during Shin’s funeral at Ansan Hospital in Seoul. “The script I hear is almost complete, and I was really looking forward to starring with him in the film.”</p><p align=left>Shin is survived by his wife, Um, and their son and two daughters.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofLS0yKdkrJ2fo7Rutctmm56ZlGK5prPEp5uaqqliwLDB06FkpKeimq6vecCcq6iqXayutHmXamRqaWVtfXSCjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
