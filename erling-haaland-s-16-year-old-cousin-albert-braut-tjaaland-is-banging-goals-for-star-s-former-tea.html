I wasn't expecting to make the debut already, less than a month after I turned 16."</p><h2>Similarities to Haaland</h2><p>There are more similarities between the pair than just their bleach blonde hair.</p><p>Tjaaland is just a few months behind his cousin when it came to making his debut.</p><p>Haaland was 15 when he pulled on the Bryne shirt for the first time - four years later he has scored eight Champions League goals in six appearances including two against Paris Saint-Germain.</p><p>Like the Borussia Dortmund ace, Tjaaland also plays as a striker but is right-footed.</p><p>VG write he has all the same traits as Haaland by claiming he has "power, speed and is physical."</p><p>Not only that, he stands at over six feet tall - all the attributes needed to be a prolific goalscorer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000567995268.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NINTCHDBPICT000564065427.jpg><h2>Scoring for fun</h2><p>It is no wonder he has already been handed his opportunity in the first team after a frightening goal record at youth level.</p><p>Stats doing the rounds online suggest he has bagged 30 in 22 games across one season.</p><p>Another junior campaign also claims he has a whopping 34 goals in 15 appearances.</p><p>He may need to remain patient before getting on the scoresheet for the senior side in the Norwegian second division side.</p><p>Haaland had to wait 422 minutes to bag his first senior strike in Norway but after that it was raining goals.</p><p>It would be no surprise to know who Tjaaland's inspiration is on the field.</p><p>He told VG: "He (Haaland) is a great inspiration. It's amazing what he's done. What he manages to show in every match."</p><h2>Future's bright for Norway</h2><p>Norway, who sit 44th in the Fifa world rankings, could boast one of the most fearful attacks in international football.</p><p>If his development is anything like his cousin, then Norway will have Haaland and Tjaaland causing havoc among defences.</p><p>And who could forget Real Madrid superstar Martin Odegaard playing in the No10 role behind them.</p><p>The 21-year-old is currently on loan at Real Sociedad where he continues to shine in LaLiga.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in football</h2></p><p>He has scored seven goals and five assists this campaign including against his parent club Real in the Copa Del Rey.</p><p>But Tjaaland is not getting ahead of himself.</p><p>When quizzed on his future ambitions, he responded: "I want to reach as far as possible, the goal is to get up to the a-team and make a debut in Division 2 this year. It's just hard work."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GL-graphic-sports-clauses.jpg><span class=article__bc_video-caption> Erling Haaland slams ‘comical’ wage demand rumours as Dortmund striker explains why he snubbed Solskjaer and Man Utd</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK570qmmq6xfm7ywwMGao6VnoKeyrrXEq2SlnZGcwqZ7k3FramlmZLqmsdNmnKukmaO0brTAmqOappSoenKCjLKcmqpdpLmlecKorKyhnmLEqbuMoqpmmpGjtKq6xmaeqJmcqHqquoybpquto6i2onnDqKmtpaWjsW6%2F05qprGWWpL%2BusdFmq56ZnWKvs8XNnmSfo18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
