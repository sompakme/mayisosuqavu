Since his debut, Danielson has only worn a plain white t-shirt and this made fans wonder if there was a special reason for it.</p><p>While spkeaing to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Justin Barrasso of Sports Illustrated</a>, Bryan Danielson explained that he wears a plain white t-shirt intentionally so that he can see if what he presents and what he does is enough with everything stripped down to the bare minimum.</p><p>“That’s been an intentional thing on my part. Not wearing a merchandise shirt, not wearing a Bryan Danielson shirt. Not that I won’t in the future, but the idea is to strip everything down and see if what I present and what I do is enough. And I think it is. I’m at a point in my career where I really want to challenge myself. If I wasn’t already known to people, could I come in and get massively over? I think about that a lot. I also try to simplify my life. The older I get, the less I need. A plain white T-shirt is exactly that in its most abstract form.”</p><p>Bryan Danielson had an instant classic match against AEW World Champion Kenny Omega on this week’s episode of AEW Dynamite Grand Slam. It remains to be seen if the two will face off against each other in the future or not.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
