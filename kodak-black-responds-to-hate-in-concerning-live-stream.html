Speculation first began to gain traction at the end of last month, when Kodak appeared on an episode of Drink Champs. Viewers took note of some confusing behavior, and a few of his celebrity peers even spoke out about it publicly.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">When <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ray J</a> expressed concern for him on social media, however, Kodak Black fired back. He <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">insisted that he doesn't need help</a>, threatening to beat Ray J up in the process. Some others, including Wack 100, have come to the rapper's defense, claiming that the rumors are false. Regardless, countless commenters have weighed in on the situation, and continue to push for him to change his lifestyle.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kodak-black-speaks-out-amid-health-concerns>Kodak Black Speaks Out Amid Health Concerns</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Unfortunately, it appears as though Kodak's not taking well to the outpouring of concern. During a recent live stream, the hitmaker discussed all the "hate" he's been receiving lately. He displayed some unusual behavior during the stream, only generating <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">more concern among fans</a>. On stream, he referred to himself as a "clone" while hanging out in his bathroom. It's unclear exactly what the rapper was trying to communicate next, but essentially, he said that he's only receiving "hate" due to his success.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Several commenters are now pointing out physical changes they claim to see in Kodak Black's appearance, which they're attributing to his alleged drug use. He also seems to be <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">misinterpreting genuine concern for "hate."</a> While it's possible that his behavior is just a result of an eccentric personality, it's getting increasingly difficult for his supporters to ignore.
