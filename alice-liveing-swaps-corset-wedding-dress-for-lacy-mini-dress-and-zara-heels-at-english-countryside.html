The bride looked exquisite in a custom-made Emma Beaumont wedding dress made of delicately embroidered lace, which featured a structured corset bodice with a square neckline, lace sleeves and a long train.</p><p id=eiUsF5Wzq51 data-wc=23>A simple white bouquet and a cathedral-length veil trimmed with lace completed Alice's bridal look, which she switched up for the evening reception.&nbsp;</p><p id=epjFn4bd1ON data-wc=51>Despite being made of similarly luxurious lace material, her second bridal mini dress was a more daring option since it highlighted one of Alice's biggest insecurities. Alice told HELLO!: "I had always envisaged having sleeves on both my dresses as it’s my default clothing choice having grown up hating my arms.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/12ddd16f376b-alice-liveing-second-wedding-dress.jpg><p id=eRK0BPYAjhn data-wc=39>"But, at some point, Emma, my dress designer and I decided that having a dancing dress that actually restricted your dancing wasn’t a sensible choice, and we also both felt the dress looked much better without the sleeves anyway.</p><p id=eMGP1ktMs67 data-wc=35>"I was so happy with the finished result, and I was having the time of my life on my wedding day that I didn’t for a moment stop to worry about how my arms looked."</p><h2 dir=ltr>'Tricky' bridal heels</h2><p id=eQyS6JsHE41 data-wc=23>The search for her bridal outfits took over a year, but she admitted her wedding shoes proved the most "tricky" part to perfect.</p><p id=elSOVFv6t1T data-wc=33>"I visited Emma’s studio in Manchester a total of 8 times across the year, each time staying for at least four hours whilst the dress was pinned and altered on me," she said.</p><p id=e8z9lGhnf0q data-wc=52>Alice was very prepared when it came to her first set of footwear, which could have acted as her 'something old'. "Shoes-wise, I was both very organised and not organised at all. My wedding shoes that I wore with my first dress I embarrassingly bought before Paddy and I were even engaged.&nbsp;</p><p id=e1bq-I_ajYZ data-wc=54>"I just knew that we’d eventually get married, and I saw the Jimmy Choo pearl shoes and fell in love with them. I had no idea what type of dress I’d end up wearing, but I just adored the design and the style of them that I knew those were to be my shoes.</p><p id=eIR2M1pne3H8 data-wc=64>"My shoes for the second dress were a little more tricky. I ordered multiple pairs, none of which were right, and eventually made a panic purchase of the Zara shoes a few days before my bridal fitting. They were so comfy and went so perfectly with my dress that I decided I didn’t need to waste any more time finding anything else," she said.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Emotional wedding moments</h2><p id=e5G1OANbdNsn data-wc=41>After explaining her family are "private people", Alice couldn't resist sharing her emotional wedding dress reveal with her father on Instagram. The father-of-the-bride looked speechless as he bundled her into his arms for a tight hug in an intimate behind-the-scenes moment.</p><p id=efO0FJHby8ks data-wc=77>The bride, who recently released her book Give Me Strength, recalled that was one of many tearful moments throughout her special day. "I sat down to write [my vows] about a week before and properly sobbed as I did so. To say them in front of all our friends and family felt impossible, but after a few big deep breaths, I managed to get them out without crying, although my voice did wobble a lot," she confessed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2472321dc2e9-alice-liveing-rings.jpg><p id=eHkIi7A63U_m data-wc=21>"Paddy was a little more composed than me, but he had a little tear during his speech which was very special."</p><h2 dir=ltr>Wedding tips</h2><p id=eo10KBfH6ZYq data-wc=36>The couple, who started dating in 2016 after meeting through a dating app, concluded that their wedding "fulfilled every single dream" and would not have been possible without the help of "invaluable" wedding planner Alice Wilkes.&nbsp;</p><figure class="videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff -recommended-video"><span class=videoPlayerStyleHeader_v1l4r7u3>Recommended video</span><span class=videoPlayerStyleTitle_v1pm0z4u>You may also like</span>WATCH: 9 of the most stunning celebrity weddings</figure><p id=ejCMXBHwd3kB data-wc=48>Sharing her tips for fellow brides and grooms, fitness influencer Alice said: "We had a schedule for the day mapped out around a week before, with timings for everything from make-up in the morning, to what time we’d cut our cake, and when we’d do our first dance.&nbsp;</p><p id=ezFPnAHZAwsR data-wc=29>"Whilst it might seem a little militant, when you’re having fun and have had a few drinks, it can be easy for the night to run away with you."</p><p id=eh1R9FdfzY3B data-wc=15></p><p id=ewmkR_JrMbk data-wc=16><strong>READ NEXT:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Strictly Come Dancing star Scott Mills weds fiancé Sam Vaughan in beautiful Barcelona wedding</a></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
