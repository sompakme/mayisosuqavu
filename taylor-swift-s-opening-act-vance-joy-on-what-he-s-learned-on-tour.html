But before the “Bad Blood” singer takes the stage to belt out chart-topping hits and introduce an army of models, comedians, actresses, and friends, there’s only one person that riles the riotous crowd night after night: Vance Joy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At 27-years-old, the handsome 6’4” Australian musician is known for his adorable curly locks, soothing vocals, and his guitar, which he totes arou about everywhere he goes. So how does the performer muster up the courage to sing in front of a stadium packed with Swifties? “You just need to bring people in, speak slowly, and you can engage with a big stadium,” he tells InStyle. “I really liked Seattle. It started to rain and I felt really great energy off of that crowd. It was awesome. It was kind of epic.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course Joy is a solo act and has the chops to steal the show independently, however, it’s Swift who has inspired him these past few months on the road. “I’ve definitely come out of my shell more because more is required when you’re performing for a Taylor Swift audience,” Joy says. Swift, naturally, has shown him a thing or two about creating memorable experiences for the audience. “She talks to the crowd really well. I think she could do anything," Joy adds. "She could be like an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Oprah</a> figure the way she talks to people. It’s motivational and inspiring.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For Joy, it’s not just Swift who’s showing him the touring ropes. “Sometimes her manager or her dad might suggest something,” he says. “On the second show, [her dad] said, ‘Just say to the crowd, Hi, I’m Vance Joy, how are you doing?, and to speak stadium slow. Don’t speak quickly.' So, I've tried to incorporate that since he said that, and he was right on.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Joy, who’s preparing to release a bevy of new songs in September, cites Swift BFF <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Lorde</a> as the 1989 guest star that’s truly taken his breath away, adding, “I screamed a bit” when she took the stage. We wouldn’t have reacted any differently.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">—With reporting by Brandi Fowler</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Taylor Swift's Cat, Olivia Benson, Was Born to Fight Crime</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeklsatu9FmqrChlqnAbn2YcXBmrpGjsKZ5yaiwZq%2BYlsFutMRmo56ZoqOypXnOp2Stp6Wn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
