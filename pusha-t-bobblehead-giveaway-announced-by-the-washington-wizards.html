You know, when I first heard the opportunity, I thought it was an honor. I looked it as an honor, honestly," Pusha said.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, the Wizards highlighted Pusha's ties to the team. "Growing up in Virginia Beach, he was drawn towards the Wizards (then known as the Bullets) given their proximity.&nbsp;&nbsp;“Where I’m from in Virginia, the closest team that we had to us was the Wizards. So, we naturally gravitated in fanfare to the Wizards. It’s always been like that since they were the Bullets. I just have such a strong history, it’s always been very supportive, D.C. has always been supportive of my music career,” he said. But his affinity for the DMV has continued into adulthood, as he moved to Bethesda in the mid-2010s, where his relationship with the Wizards grew deeper," a press release read.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-pusha-t-needle-drop-hypes-modern-warfare-iii-trailer>Pusha T Needle Drop Hypes Modern Warfare III Trailer</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, NBA bobbleheads aren't the only pop culture thing Pusha has been involved in recently. A teaser for Modern Warfare III teaser followed main antagonist Makarov being escorted through prison to receive a new tattoo. Meanwhile, Soap gives one of his usual sonorous monologues about stopping evil. This is overlaid with footage of some of the game's more iconic moments - a terror attack in London, Makarov bringing down a plane carrying the President of Russia. All in all, it was a hyped trailer ahead of the game's main reveal last August.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">A majority of the trailer is scored to Colonel Bagshot's 1971 single "Six Day War". However, right at the end, as Makarov looks at the camera, there is an amazing Pusha <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">needle drop</a>. Pusha sampled "Six Day War" on "Just So You Remember" last year and it's that intense line (My Joker smile, you know who the villain is/Just so you remember who you dealin’ with…) that hear right at the end of the video. Furthermore, Pusha shared the video to his Instagram with the lyrics in the caption.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Benjamin Mock (they/them) is a sports and culture writer working out of Philadelphia.
