However, back in May, hip-hop heads were surprised to find out about the <a href=# rel>drama</a> between the Indiana native and his former partner, known online as The Fit Mami. During their relationship, the rapper and adult actress seemed all smiles, but according to her, he bailed on their future plans after finding out she was pregnant, suddenly feeling unready to take on the responsibility of more <a href=# rel>children</a>. "He had this idea that we would name the baby Penny, like Penny Hardaway if he was a boy. BFFR," she wrote on Twitter at the time.</p><p>"When I told Freddie his tone immediately changed," the content creator, whose name is Destini, noted. "I'm so confused at this point, because have we not been talking about having a baby for the last eight months??"

Her body looks as snatched as ever after giving birth, and the 39-year-old wasn't shy about wrapping his hands around her bare midsection while leaning in to whisper sweet nothings in her ear. We're curious to see what, if anything, Gibbs will have to say about this, and we'll be sure to keep you up to date on the situation.</p><p>His <a href=# rel>public feud with The Fit Mami</a> this spring (and her new photos with The Butcher) aren't the only ones we've seen Freddie Gibbs take in 2023. While showing off a massive new tattoo to fans a few months back, they showed no mercy when roasting him over the artwork.
