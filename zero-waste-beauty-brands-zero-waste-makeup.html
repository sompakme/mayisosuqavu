So, what's a beauty lover to do?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While you might feel helpless, there are many ways to be more green in your routine, from switching to reusable makeup wipes, to finishing a foundation down to the last drop, or using an eyeshadow palette until you hit the pan. But one of the most crucial ways you can be part of the solution is with your purchasing power.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are many environmentally-conscious brands that have been committed to creating less waste and implementing sustainable practices. And while it might sound hypocritical — creating more "stuff" in an space that's already oversaturated with "stuff" — we think that these beauty brands are making a much-needed change in the industry, while also urging all of us to think more about the state of the world and beauty's part in it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here are 10 zero-waste beauty brands to support now and always.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-w3ll-people></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>W3LL PEOPLE</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-low-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Expressionist Pro Mascara</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To buy:</strong> $20, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>target.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ever since W3LL People was started in 2008, the brand has been committed to creating quality products using organic, plant-based ingredients (like algae, beeswax, and broccoli seed oil) in the most sustainable way. All of their products — from their best-selling mascara to their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored noopener nofollow">cult-favorite foundation stick</a> are packaged using Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified paper stocks. And in addition to being one of the founding members of the EWG Verified program, the brand donates 1.5% of its sales to support the work of the Environmental Working Group (EWG).

The brand was created by Danish makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Kirsten Kjaer Weis</a> whose clients experienced sensitivities to the synthetic ingredients in the products she had been using. This prompted her to create her own line, which features organic, eco-conscious cosmetics, including the brand's popular cream foundation and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>cream blush</a>, all packaged in refillable metal compacts or recyclable and compostable alternatives.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ilia></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Ilia</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Tinted Lip Conditioner</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To buy:</strong> $28, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>sephora.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ilia's modern approach to clean beauty is different from others — they don't believe that all synthetics are bad and that all natural ingredients are good. Instead, they focus on using eco-conscious ingredients that are both innovative, effective, and safe for your skin. The same goes for packaging. The Laguna Beach-based brand knows that there's more to sustainable lipstick bullets, compacts, and boxes than just using vegetable dyes and recycled aluminum. That's why Ilia teamed up with TerraCycle's Zero Waste Box platform. U.S. customers are asked to mail in up to five empty beauty products per month (whether it's from Ilia or not), so TerraCycle can break them down responsibly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Shopping for Makeup Post COVID-19 Lockdown Will Never Be the Same</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-croon></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Croon</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Starter Kit 1+1</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To buy:</strong> $29, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored noopener nofollow">justcroon.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By now, most of us realize how wasteful using makeup remover wipes and cotton rounds are. Thankfully, brands like Croon are popping up on the scene, offering us an eco-friendly alternative to wiping off our mascara and lipstick without compromising a clean face. Croon creates reusable microfiber pads that can remove makeup, exfoliate, and cleanse only using water. What's more, the pads are reusable for up to 200 washes — the equivalent of 400 makeup wipes.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-noto></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Noto</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Ono Ono Multi-Benne Stain Stick</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To buy:</strong> $19, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored noopener nofollow">notobotanics.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Noto knows that as a beauty brand, a lot needs to be done in order to reduce its ecological footprint. That's why it has dedicated every day to evolving with the world of sustainability, starting from the renewable-made, biodegradable paper tape it uses to ship its products with to using ingredients that are locally sourced, vegan, cruelty-free, and fair-trade certified. Noto has also made its sustainable goals visible on its website so customers can know what to expect, as well as be able to hold the brand accountable. This is the kind of transparency we need and want from our clean beauty brands.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-juice-beauty></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Juice Beauty</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Phyto-pigments Juice Boost</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To buy:</strong> $25, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>goop.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Juice Beauty prides itself not just on its farm-to-beauty formulations made with homegrown or locally-sourced organic ingredients, but also its sustainability in both its packaging and its practices as a company. The clean beauty brand uses 100% FSC paper, 100% Bioresin sample and travel tubes, and glass for 32% of its packaging. Additionally, the Northern California brand's headquarters and farm are both sustainable, with almost all of the farm's operations being solar powered.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-loli></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Loli</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Date Nut Brulee</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To buy:</strong> $48, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored noopener nofollow">lolibeauty.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Haven't heard of Loli Beauty? If you're a clean beauty lover, you need to. Founded in 2014, Loli (which stands for Living Organic Loving Ingredients) is a Made Safe-certified, waterless beauty brand sourcing organic, wild-harvested ingredients that are non-GMO and fair trade as well as raw and upcycled food sources. While this previous sentence might sound like a lot of sustainable buzzwords squished together, founder Tina Hedges believes that when it comes to being a leader in the clean and green beauty movement, you must create a full-circle brand, from ingredients to the supply chain. As a result, Loli is considered the first completely zero-waste beauty brand on the market.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ethique></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Ethique</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-low-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_77-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Frizz Wrangler</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_79-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To buy:</strong> $15, target.com</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_81-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There is a huge push to reduce packaging in beauty products, as the oceans continue to be filled with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored noopener">80 billion plastic bottles every year</a>. New Zealand brand Ethique does just that, only offering solid shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and skincare bars that are cruelty-free, waste-free, and are made and packaged with biodegradable materials. The brand was started by biologist Brianne West after realizing how much water was wasted in traditional shampoo and conditioner formulations. She set out to create solid products packed with natural ingredients (and no water) that could last up to five times longer than its liquid counterparts.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-by-humankind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_83-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>by Humankind</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_84-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_85-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Refillable Deodorant</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_87-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To buy:</strong> $12, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>byhumankind.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_89-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Similar to Ethique, By Humankind set out to eliminate single-use plastic. But that does not mean the refillable deodorant canisters or soap bars are not chic or beautifully designed. The packaging is minimal, but feels luxurious and looks great on your vanity. The best part? You can keep using it once you're done with the product inside. The idea behind By Humankind is that once you've finished, you can simply order a refill instead of an entirely new product.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMemvs5mrpqrpJp6rq3Knqyp</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
