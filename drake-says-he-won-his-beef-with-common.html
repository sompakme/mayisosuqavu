I reacted in a very poised way. First of all, I made sure it would run in the club because that's more painful than anything. As opposed to just being on a blog, I wanted to be on a record that you would have to stand around and hear every night for a few months. That was my whole strategy going into that. Instead of sounding hurt and malicious, I wanted to sound fun, get my shit off. Like I said, if it happens again, not that I want it, not that I welcome it, but I'm ready. I really enjoy writing bars, man. I'm not nervous about anybody saying anything to me.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It seemed like you won, but his last line was good.</strong>&nbsp;<br>The Canada Dry line? That was epic. I liked it. It wasn't a good line necessarily, but it was funny.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Did he step over the line when he scorned you for being biracial?</strong><br>For you to delve into my mom and my dad's a bitch and all that, you're just reaching for impact moments but the bars aren't really good so it didn't hit me. I never sat back and analyzed that either. I only heard it once, and thought, "I think I came away with the W on that one."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhaYR2f4ydqZqjlWLAosXSZp%2BeZaeku260yKxkm5mkqbmmedaiq6Flk6S6rrvNZqWer6M%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
