In honor of International Women's Day, the actor posted a photo of Tiffani Thiessen on his Instagram Stories, along with the caption, "Happy International Woman's Day" (via <a href=#>People</a>). Sounds like Thiessen must be pretty memorable to Green to make it into the post!&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>According to <a href=#>The Things</a>, Green and Thiessen dated on the set of "Beverly Hills 90210," and Green struggled when it came to watching his GF kiss other men on the show. Per The Things, executive producer Charles Rosin said that watching Thiessen on-screen was "very hard for Brian. It was pretty clear given how he was reacting to Tiffani experimenting with her acting, as much as anything with her roles and herself being young, that it was unlikely they could stay together as a couple."</p><p>Thiessen herself was aware of the uncomfortable dynamic she'd created by kissing someone other than her then-boyfriend, even if it was just for the cameras. In 2015, the actor described her on-screen smooch with Luke Perry's Dylan McKay as "awkward," according to <a href=#>ABC News</a>.&nbsp;"That was probably the more awkward thing," she said on <a href=#>"The Meredith Vieira Show."</a>&nbsp;"Literally having your boyfriend on the show and then literally kissing another man, 'I'm getting paid for this, honey. I don't know what to tell you.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2hmZoFze9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2Xv6qtzWaYrquknrtus9GenKdlkaOxbsDIn52appliwam1xKyqnqajYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
