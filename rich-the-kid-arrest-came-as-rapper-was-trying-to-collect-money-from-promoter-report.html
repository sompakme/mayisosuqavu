As you may have heard, the "New Freezer" artist was arrested when forcing his way into a hotel amid a bomb threat. At the time, he allegedly told security attempting to stop him he would "bond out in 20 minutes" should they choose to take him in. Now, The Shade Room has an exclusive update on why Rich was reportedly so eager to get into his suite at the SLS Hotel as police were responding to a bomb threat last night.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">A source close to The Kid tells the outlet that he was due to perform at Hyde Beach Nightclub, which is inside the venue. He and the promoter were planning to meet up so he could collect his payment for the concert, which also scheduled slots for <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>NLE Choppa</a>. He was heading to the front of the building to meet the event organizer and get his money. Unfortunately, he wasn't able to accomplish his goal.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-rich-the-kid-update>Rich The Kid Update</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Before Rich's meeting, a worrying call came to the police from the SLS. Now, some social media users are speculating whether it was the promoter avoiding paying the rapper. "Ahaha they didn't have the money so staged a bomb threat lol," one user speculated. "Ni**a Was Ready To Die With The Money In Hand ðŸ˜‚," another Instagram user quipped in TSR's comment section after reading the news.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">After the ups and downs of this past year, Rich The Kid is likely looking forward to starting fresh in 2024. Besides this <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">arrest</a>, there's also the backlash from when he was <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">cheating on Tori Brixx</a> in the spring.
