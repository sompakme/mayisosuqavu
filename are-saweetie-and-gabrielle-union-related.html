Once she rose to fame, the news of the "Pretty B***h Freestyle" rapper's family became more prominent â€” especially her familial ties to Gabrielle Union. In December 2018, Union revealed she and Saweetie are related when a Twitter follower asked. "Her father and I are 1st cousins," Union <a href=#>tweeted</a>. "Her grandma is my aunt Joanne Glass who I based Eva from 'Deliver Us From Eva' on. #FunFact #DozensOfCousins."</p><p dir=ltr>Saweetie and Union have a great relationship as well; when "My Type" became a hit back in 2019, the "Being Mary Jane" star showed Saweetie love via <a href=#>Instagram</a> by participating in the #MyTypeChallenge. The caption read, "Always support my fam." Saweetie also <a href=#>performed</a> at Union's birthday party in that same year, in which the two cousins donned matching Clovers cheerleading costumes from Union's breakout role in "Bring It On" (2002).</p><p dir=ltr>Gabrielle Union isn't the only familiar face in Saweetie's star-studded family. In fact, Saweetie is also related to rap legend <a href=#>MC Hammer</a> and Grammy-winning producer Zaytoven. "Our family grew up with the Burrell's [MC Hammer's family]. My cousin's dad is MC Hammer, and another one of my cousins is Zaytoven," Saweetie told Billboard in 2018. "We all grew up together and it's interesting to see how we turned out." It's clear that the rapper's family is full of talented people, and it's only right to expect nothing less of her. We love to see it!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbXBmaIZze8CrnGarkayypsDInmSappRitKKu0aKcpaSVYsKvtc6nZKudnJbBprCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
