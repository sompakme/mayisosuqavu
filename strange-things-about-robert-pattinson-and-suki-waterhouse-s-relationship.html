As <a href=#>Architectural Digest</a> reported in February 2023, the couple bought a home in the Hollywood Hills built in 1939 for a cool $5.3 million. Waterhouse shared on the "Driven Minds: A Type 7 Podcast" that October that this was her first time living with someone and it took some major adjusting. "I just went past my house last night, my old apartment, which I spent eight years in, and I suddenly was getting, like, the heartburn for that street ... I was like, 'I can't believe I'm not there anymore and now I have to consider someone else,'" she mused.</p><p dir=ltr>For his part, Pattinson also had to make some adjustments. "I am an incredibly messy human," Waterhouse admitted. What's more, for the first six months, she actually didn't unpack. "I wasn't there for the move, so everything just got boxed up and sent," she explained. It stayed like that until October when she finally couldn't handle it anymore. "It's gotten so bad that I had a professional cleaner come in yesterday," she told the podcast.</p><p dir=ltr>Thankfully, her partner just went with the flow. "I'm very lucky because he is so accepting of the mess and the chaos," the singer revealed. "He never says anything about it. He kind of thinks it's, like, charming."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxnZn96gI6sq6uZnpyybsDHoqWgq12nvKOx0a1kqZmkqbavv86nZKytm556uK3Tnqmhp6WosrR50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
