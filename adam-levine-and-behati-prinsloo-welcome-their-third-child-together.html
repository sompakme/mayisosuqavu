We want a big family, who knows?</p><p>“We’re leaving it up to fate and just what happens. What will happen, will happen. So there’s no limits to it.”</p><p>She carried on, “I think it’s just kind of where we are in our life. And with COVID too, I was just seeing [Dusty and Gio] together, I’m like, ‘Maybe we should have a third just to have more kids,’ because it was so sweet to see [them together]. But then I don’t know.
