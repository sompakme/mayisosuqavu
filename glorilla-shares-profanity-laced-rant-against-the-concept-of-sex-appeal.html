She's no stranger to showing off her good looks in memorable outfits and has become an expert at flexing sensual dance moves in her music videos. That was the case once again with her most recent single "Wanna Be" which features <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Megan Thee Stallion</a>. The sensual video attached to the song features Megan and Glo throwing their own version of a frat party.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Even though sex appeal has always been part of GloRilla's creative output, she recently made a post speaking out against the very concept. "Mfs luv talking about sex appeal baby f*ck da sex appeal I got DA SEX dats what's gone get ya n*gga took in real life, PUSSY GOOD CHECK ion gotta do allat extra shit Fym you hoes be sexy ash with no walls coochie dry asf f*ck outta here," her profanity-laced tweet reads. Despite her all over the place point, many fans in the replies completely agree with what she's saying. Check out the post and some of the reactions to it below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-glorilla-fires-off-about-sex-appeal>GloRilla Fires Off About Sex Appeal</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Earlier this year, GloRilla appeared a few times on the Gangsta Art 2 compilation album for her label CMG. She handles the opening track all by herself and later hops on the posse cut "Wrong One." The track that got the most attention was "Cha Cha Cha" with Fivio Foreign, though for the most part it wasn't exactly positive attention. What do you think of GloRilla;s rant against sex appeal and in favor of having receipts? Do you agree with her take that sex appeal isn't everything?
