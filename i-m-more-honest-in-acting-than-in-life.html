People have always pointed out my distinctive features – my top lip or my eyebrows – even when I was very young. They’d call me ‘ski-jump lip’ and all sorts of stuff; my family as much as anyone else. So I was always aware that I had these features that I couldn’t do much about.”</p><p>For a stage actress who, at 33, has already won two Olivier awards and was this week nominated for a Tony for her Broadway debut in Constellations, that face – those architectural eyebrows, the extravagant curve of the upper lip – has proved a major asset. “I think it is the biggest gift that I’ve got,” she admits. Its natural expressiveness has helped her become one of the leading British theatre actresses of her generation: even in silence she has an uncanny, and deeply affecting, ability to convey a character’s innermost feelings.</p><p>“I am transparent in that way. I can’t really hide anything. I can’t lie.” She smiles and withdraws her hands into the sleeves of her chunky woollen jumper. “Which is awful in many ways.”</p><h3>Filming a bonk-buster</h3><p>But when it comes to screen acting, different rules apply. She has achieved a successful parallel career in film and television – from her 2006 breakthrough in the title role of the BBC’s Jane Eyre, and the smoulderingly sociopathic Alice Morgan opposite Idris Elba in detective drama Luther to smaller parts on bigger screens in The Lone Ranger, Saving Mr Banks and Anna Karenina – only by reining in her instinctive expressiveness. “How I am talking to you now, I would never do this on camera,” she says. “I have to pull down the amount of expression I make. Otherwise it would be too much for the screen.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03287/ruthwilson5_3287924b.jpg><p>The plain little governess: Wilson with Toby Stephens in the 2006 adaptation of Jane Eyre. Photo: BBC</p><p>For proof that Wilson has beaten her aversion to the camera, you need look no further than The Affair. In this slick new American drama, from the creators of In Treatment, Wilson plays Alison, a grieving mother working as a waitress in the Long Island coastal resort of Montauk. At the start of the series, she stumbles out of the fog of grief and into a reckless affair with Noah (Dominic West), a Brooklynite on vacation at his in-laws’ beach house with his wife and four children. Wilson describes the high-concept format – in which each scene plays out twice, once from the perspective of Noah, then again from Alison’s point of view – as being an exploration “of narrative and truth and the extent to which everything is coloured by your own perception”. West calls it “a real bonk-buster”. (“Ha!” says Wilson, when I quote West on this. “Of course he does.”)</p><p>Sex is — as the title suggests — most certainly on the menu; indeed it’s dished out in portions rather more generous than one might expect from an actress who has previously criticised the glut of female nudity on our screens.</p><p>“If you are going to show sex then you have to try and make it as real as possible,” Wilson says now. “That’s what Dom and I were pushing for. Of course The Affair should have sex in it because sex is a major part of relationships. Major. But then you need to get behind the psychology of it, make it more than titillation.”</p><p>She says that for the actors, the build-up to a sex scene is, almost invariably, the most interesting bit. “The sex itself is a little, you know,&nbsp;anticlimactic.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03302/affair_3302561b.jpg><p>Ruth Wilson said she was struggling a bit towards the end of filming the first season of The Affair</p><p>The combination of all those nude scenes and the emotional demands of playing a character who, as Wilson has it, “really puts herself through the wringer and has huge guilt and huge self-loathing” made the five-month shoot, far from home, a peculiarly gruelling experience. “About five weeks from the end I was exhausted,” she says. “I had been there for three-and-a-half months and we still had to shoot the last two episodes. Then the scripts came in and they were pushing my character to new depths of despair. I just thought ‘I don’t know if I can do any more of this’. And I began to feel desperate to come home.”</p><p>Did West come to her rescue? “Actually I worked quite a bit with Josh,” she says, referring to Joshua Jackson, her onscreen husband. “He was more open to working on scenes. But Dom? Dom's brilliant – he doesn't like to over-think or over-analyse anything. He'll just wing it.”</p><p>So she rang her mother, a former probation officer and social worker, who dropped everything and jumped on a plane. “She just said, ‘Right, I’m coming out’. She doesn’t get involved in my life at all much but in this case she was like, ‘You need your mum’.”</p><p>• <a href=#><b>Why British actresses get top billing in US TV</b></a></p><p>The series, which begins here on Sky Atlantic this month, has already been aired to acclaim in the US. At the Golden Globes in January, it won the prize for best television drama series and Wilson picked up the best actress gong, seven years after her first nomination, for Jane Eyre. She approached the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles with, she says, some trepidation.</p><p>“It’s awful, but that is where I get the most anxiety, finding an outfit for an event. There is a risk that you end up fitting the mould that everyone else has created of a Hollywood star: girls that go into the industry are quickly made to look like all the other girls in the industry. I can’t really stand gowns, never have liked them, so I try my hardest to keep individual, but I don’t find it joyful looking for an outfit. It freaks me out.”</p><p>Not that you’d know any of this from the cool manner in which she took to the stage, dressed in a figure-hugging green Prada dress, to claim her prize over such formidable competition as Claire Danes, Robin Wright, Juliana Marguiles and Viola Davis. She concluded her acceptance speech with a shout-out to her co-star: “Dom, your arse is something of great beauty and do not let anyone tell you otherwise”. It was the kind of plum moment for the Sisterhood that’s rare in Hollywood: West left the ceremony not only empty-handed (pipped to the best actor prize by Kevin Spacey for House of Cards) but also having been reduced to a piece of ass.</p><p>So began a career-defining week for Wilson. Two days later, the Broadway transfer of Constellations, Nick Payne’s two-hander about love and quantum physics, opened to ecstatic reviews with Wilson and Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead roles.</p><p>“That week, I could feel an energy, coming off the win and then the adrenalin of opening night,” says Wilson. “But that quickly goes and then two weeks later you are still doing the same play, everyone’s forgotten about the Golden Globes and you are looking for the next job.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03287/ruthwilson2_3287921b.jpg><p>The appliance of science: Wilson with Jake Gyllenhaal in Constellations. Photo: Getty Images</p><p>The critics picked up on her onstage chemistry with her leading man, just as they had four years earlier in her Olivier-winning performance of Anna Christie opposite Jude Law.</p><p>• <a href=#><b>Why the Brits are ruling Broadway</b></a></p><p>“From my point of view, when people have commented on chemistry it’s because there has actually been chemistry,” says Wilson. “It’s bizarre but sometimes [in acting] you are being more truthful and more open and more honest than you would ever be in the same situation in your own life. I think in my own relationships I am probably less expressive in some ways. I am quite straight, quite Zen, not particularly dramatic. I kind of save it for my work. That’s why our job’s quite weird, you have to make very intense relationships quickly. And then they break and you don’t see that person for years.”</p><p>In real life, she says, she’s not in a relationship and trying her best to ignore “the enormous pressure as a woman of my age, that by this stage I should be settling and having kids. My mum had four by my age.”</p><p>As the sister of three elder brothers growing up in Surrey, Wilson was “thrown off things and pushed off things and beaten up on a daily basis”. She attended a Catholic girls school where she was a not-quite-straight A student – “One B. Maths” – and captain of the netball team. “I also did rounders and athletics. If anything defined me it was sport. I didn’t do any acting then. The school show was always a musical and I hated musicals so I refused to be part of it.”</p><h3>From cover girl to leading lady</h3><p>At 16 she had a short-lived flirtation with modelling after a scout for the London-based agency, Select, spotted her working in a café during the school holidays. For the rest of that summer, Wilson would go up to London for castings on her days off.</p><p>“I didn’t put much effort into it,” she says. “Four seconds, they look at a sheet of Polaroids and you are out the door. Or they look at your legs, lift up your skirt, and I instantly thought, ‘This is bizarre’. I remember a woman who would inspect your face, really stare at your skin. And all of the models that were walking through were like four feet taller than me and willowy and blonde and Polish.”</p><p>Within six weeks, she’d landed the cover of teen magazine, Mizz “with my hair in bunches and an inane grin on my face, looking about 12 years old”. She quit shortly after.</p><p>From school she went to Nottingham University where she read history and fell in with a theatre crowd that included Michael Longhurst who, 15 years later, would direct her in Constellations on Broadway. Then, after two years at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, she almost immediately got the role in Jane Eyre and has barely been out of work since.</p><p>Now, back in England since March after almost a year away in New York, she is enjoying a rare break in her schedule. She has recently bought her first property — a warehouse conversion just down the road from where we meet in Southwark, paid for with her earnings from series one of The Affair – and has been reading various scripts before returning to Montauk next month to shoot series two. When that finishes, in November, she’ll probably plump for a film role, she says, but she’s sceptical of the received wisdom that Hollywood is the only destination for an actress with soaring ambition.</p><p>“What, being in 15 Avengers films, is that really the ultimate goal?” she asks. “These days in terms of satisfaction for an actor, I’m not sure that’s where the pinnacle really is. It’s a strange industry, the film industry.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03287/ruthwilson3_3287939b.jpg><p>Blockbuster territory: Wilson in The Lone Ranger. Photo: Peter Mountain</p><p>Although, she adds quickly, she had “the best time” filming The Lone Ranger, the 2013 film that was meant to launch a new mega-franchise for the Pirates of the Caribbean team. Wilson had signed on for three films, but it sank without trace.</p><p>“I still want to be part of movies,” she says, “I don’t want to dismiss them in any way.”</p><p>Would she even return to blockbuster territory if, for example, Marvel came knocking? “If I could play a baddie in one of those things, I would love to.”</p><h3>The end of Alice?</h3><p>Talking of baddies, for a while she had imagined she would be spending this spring reprising the role of Alice in two new special episodes of Luther.</p><p>“I thought it was going to happen between finishing the play and going back to The Affair, in this slot now,” she says. But then she discovered she wasn’t actually in it. Why on earth not? Her deliciously warped character has always felt like the main reason to tune in.</p><p>“You’ll probably have to ask Neil Cross why I’m not in this one. He’s the writer. I don’t quite know what happened and he still hasn’t given me a full explanation.” She bites her lip, but the face that never lies doesn’t look very happy about it. Is she disappointed? “Yeah, a little bit. I love the show and I love the character and I feel hugely loyal to Alice and to that fan base.”</p><p>• <a href=#><b>The best TV shows on Netflix UK</b></a></p><p>“It’s a shame,” she adds, “but these things happen. There’s always the opportunity in the future.” She pauses, scowling slightly. “At least, I don’t think I’ve been killed off…”</p><p>Alice – a child prodigy-turned murderess – is an extreme case, but she fits Wilson’s habit of choosing characters who are not like her, who she can hide behind. “I can be quite shy if attention is put on me when I am not expecting it,” she says. “I find it hard sitting round a table with a group of people when someone might suddenly say ‘Ruth, what do you think?’”. When she was 24 and filming Jane Eyre, for example, she would blush every time the camera was turned on her, “every first take, practically — and they used it sometimes. It was perfect for the character, but really it wasn’t Jane blushing, it was me”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03287/ruthwilson1_3287948b.jpg><p>Deliciously warped: Wilson with Idris Elba in Luther. Photo: BBC</p><p>When Constellations came along and she saw something she recognised in the character of Marianne, a socially awkward theoretical physicist, she finally felt ready to break the habit of a lifetime. “I resisted it for a while because it was more ‘me’ than I had ever let myself be before,” she says. “She was unapologetically brash and loud and that is a side of me, too. Often I am playing psychologically damaged or quiet outsider or manipulative and intelligent, but for once I got to play a real goofball” – albeit one with a grasp of the quantum multiverse. Wilson performed the role in her natural speaking voice, without accent or modulation – something else she had never done before.</p><p>“It unlocked me completely,” she says. “but I wouldn’t want to do too much of it. It’s good to keep a barrier, a protective barrier. As an actress, not many people see who you really are. And that,” she says, smiling, “is quite nice”.</p><p><b>The Affair starts on Sky Atlantic at 9pm on Wednesday May 13</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaJulocG2vsRoq6%2BZnpm%2ForDIqGZqaWVsg3J9k2iJrqyYYqSquNKopWaBnWK6sL7EZp%2BoppWowW61zWaYnKyZo7RuwMeapWahnmK5qrLEZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
