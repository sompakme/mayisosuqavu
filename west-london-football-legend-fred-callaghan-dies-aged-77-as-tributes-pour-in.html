Born in Parsons Green, Callaghan made more than 300 appearances for Fulham over a decade, during which he earned himself the nickname 'The Tank'.</p><p>Following his retirement from football in 1974, Callaghan had a period as manager and assistant manager for Brentford FC, also based in West London. He even became a black cab driver in London and in 2012, he became a corporate hospitality host for his former club Fulham.</p><p>Football fans have taken to social media to pay their respects, with one fan writing: "Fred was one of my original heroes, so much so that when I played football at school, I started as a left back. I had that classic shirt with the badge and [number] 3 on. Fred was a smashing character and lovely man. Condolences to his family. RIP Fred and thanks for the memories."</p><p><b>READ MORE: <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>Queen's Funeral: The 3 Premier League games postponed this weekend out of respect for the Queen</a></b></p><p>Another fan shared his memories of Callaghan, saying: "So sorry to read this, he was always a favourite. I remember at Charlton we were 2-1 down with minutes to go. Fred never came up for corners but when he did this time I knew he'd be the one to get the equaliser. Can see it now."</p><p>A statement posted by Callaghan's former club Fulham read: "Everyone at Fulham was saddened to learn of the passing of Club legend Fred Callaghan on Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>"Born just down the road in Parsons Green, Fred gave a decade of service to the Whites as a player, making his debut in a 2-2 draw away to Aston Villa in March 1964, the first of 336 appearances he would go on to rack up for the Club. Nicknamed <i>The Tank</i> on account of his storming runs down the wing and dangerous crosses, Fred primarily appeared at left-back or left-half."</p><p>He is survived by his wife Hazel, as well as his children.</p><p><b>READ NEXT:</b></p><p><b>Do you have a story you think we should be covering?
