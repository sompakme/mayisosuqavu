The comedy hit returned September 17 with its best season yet, as the students of Moordale rebelled against their new authoritarian head teacher, played by&nbsp;Girls&nbsp;actor Jemima Kirke.

The streamer announced that&nbsp;Sex Education&nbsp;will return for a season 4 at their fan event Tudum 2021. The announcement came only a week after season 3's premiere, in one of the fastest renewals for a Netflix original series in a while. While the teen comedy took a bit longer to return to expected, the streaming giant just confirmed that the show will return for its final season this fall. As we celebrate and start speculating on what could come next for Otis and the gang, here's what we know about season 4 so far.</p><h2 id=when-will-apos-sex-education-apos-season-4-come-out-3>When will 'Sex Education' season 4 come out?</h2><p>Netflix announced today that the British teen comedy will return just in time for the school year, releasing on <strong>September 21, 2023</strong>.

I felt happy for them, and I felt like I‚Äôve said everything that I want to say with these characters at this time."</p><p>Netflix previously revealed the show's return in a "Moordale News" alert posted in September 2021.

In between the clips of several characters either exploring new hookups or getting more in touch with themselves (shoutout, Aimee), Otis and and Maeve are trying to make long distance work as she's studying in the U.S. (with tutor Dan Levy).

While Gatwa and Mackey have both landed major roles since season 3, (Gatwa will soon debut as the new lead of Doctor Who, while both actors will appear in Barbie later this month), they both will appear in the new season.</p><p>Of course, the series has also brought on a new class of supporting actors for Moordale's last hoorah.

Eric broke up with Adam after realizing that he wanted to explore his self-identity without his newly-out boyfriend. After a season trying making it work with Jakob, Jean discovered that he's not the father of her baby.

To explore themselves and to be more focused either on their relationship with themselves or their platonic relationships with their friends and family," he said.</p><p>He also wished for more scenes between him and his real-life friend Gatwa. "Otis and Eric, they're most themselves when they're with each other. I wish there were more scenes with us."</p><p>Gatwa added, "We ask for that every season.
