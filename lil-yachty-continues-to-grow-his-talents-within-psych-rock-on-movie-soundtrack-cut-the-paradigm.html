He might have been already controversial simply based on his style of rap. However, this time around is a little different. Back at the beginning of the year, he took a big risk by dipping his toes into a whole other genre.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Of course, we are referring to his January release, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Let's Start Here.</a> A lot of people were on board with this switch-up. But, there was also an audience that was not for it, maybe based on previous dispositions. On top of that, Yachty also has people groaning over his takes on the state of rap, as well as his ability to out spit a majority of his contemporaries.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-listen-to-the-paradigm-by-lil-yachty>Listen To "The Paradigm" By Lil Yachty</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Even with all of that hate, you cannot deny that Yachty has done some sensational things for music. There were plenty of great cuts on the trippy rock LP, and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">his singles, </a>especially the one with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>J. Cole</a>, have been memorable. Now, he is reverting to experimenting once again with a new track. "The Paradigm" is another psychedelic rock piece that features production from SADPONY, for example, who had a hand with Let's Start Here. This song lands on a soundtrack for a brand-new Netflix film called Leave the World Behind. It is available to stream now and features performances from Julia Roberts, Mahershala Ali, Ethan Hawke, Kevin Bacon, and more.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your initial thoughts on this brand-new track, "The Paradigm," by Lil Yachty?
