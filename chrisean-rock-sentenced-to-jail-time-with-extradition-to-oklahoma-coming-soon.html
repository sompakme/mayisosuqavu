The outlet reports that Rock appeared in court on Friday, June 14th, at which time, a judge sentenced her to 30 days in jail. An agent for the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department confirmed to TSR that the warrant stems from a charge for “assault with a deadly weapon without a firearm.” They also revealed that the sentence relates only to a case filed against the rapper in California.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While the source didn't clarify which case they were referring to, James Wright Chanel filed assault charges against Rock back in the state back in February.

On top of the assault charges from James Wright Chanel, she is also dealing with a charge for "a new violent offense” against a woman in Maryland, from last August.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Cole Blake is currently an Editor at HotNewHipHop based out of Brooklyn, New York.
