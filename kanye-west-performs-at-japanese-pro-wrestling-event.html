Moreover, a clip recently surfaced of him "performing" at a Japanese pro wrestling event, although he was just in the ring miming "CARNIVAL" to the crowd. Still, we can't criticize too much; after all, seeing Ye (even with his currently misguided and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">tarnished public-facing persona</a>) is seeing Ye. Some other reports on the matter suggest that Alexander Wang organized this event over the weekend with Joshi promotion TJPW and that <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ty Dolla $ign</a> was in attendance, as well.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, this was a bizarre thing for folks to witness online with no context, but it seems like folks had a great time nonetheless. Of course, Kanye West has a lot to deal with whenever he returns to the United States, although he's probably handling that wherever he goes. A former <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Yeezy</a> employee recently sued him for alleged sexual harassment, and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">other allegations emerged about his supposed misconduct</a>. It included a lot of salacious claims accusing Ye of making non-consensual sexual advances and sending inappropriate texts and images.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kanye-west-graces-japan-with-a-pro-wrestling-event-appearance>Kanye West Graces Japan With A Pro Wrestling Event Appearance</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As far as the music side of things, Kanye West is in some hot water right now for much more light, but almost equally disseminated reasons. If you didn't catch it online over the past few days, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Rich The Kid</a> previewed what's presumably a verse from Ye for the "Gimme A Second" remix off of Rich's upcoming album, Life's A Gamble. There was <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">a particularly bad "sexist" bar</a> somewhere in there that was a hot topic on sites like Twitter for a second. But just like with most of the Chicago artist's many antics, folks quickly moved onto something else.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, we still have very little idea of how <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the aforementioned sexual harassment lawsuit</a> will develop. Kanye West plans to countersue the former Yeezy employee and denied any and all wrongdoing via his legal team. As such, maybe this could turn into a nasty court battle or they will reach a private settlement. Either way, it's a blemish on an already chaotic 2024 with as many highs as lows in many fans' eyes.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop. He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdoZoN6g5dmopqmqZp6uLHSrWSjmaCWu2680ahksKqVqMGttc2gZKmdopu8s7nAp5qeZZievW60zqlkp52nqA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
