Armpit Stains</h2><p class=align-left>This could be one of the most annoying things that could happen to your outfit. No one wants to be around people with armpit stains because it looks nasty and dirty. But the interesting thing is that this could be gone in minutes if you do this. Clean with lemon juice or baking soda. These two things are natural bleaching agents. Squeeze lemon juice onto fabric and let it sit in for a while. To take out tougher stains, make a paste of baking soda and water, apply to fabric and let it sit for an hour. Then hand wash or toss in the washing machine to wash. It will look like nothing ever happened.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/deb96d95c9b418d5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>See how these bald-headed men are getting back their hair without stress as they give baldness a bloody nose (photos)</span></p></a><h2>2. Shoe Polish</h2><p class=align-left>You have this important meeting to attend but your leather shoes look so tacky and there is no shoe polish in sight. What to do? Grab the insides of a banana peel, rub around the shoes as though you are polishing, clean the shoes with a cloth and voila!</p><h2>3. De-pill clothes with shaving sticks and sticky tape</h2><p class=align-left>Almost everyone has gone through wear and tear of polyester fabrics when they start to get old. Those little threads start to hang out causing them to look old and horrid, but you do not have a lint tape. What to do? Grab that old shaving stick you have laying around and start to scrape. Once you are done, use sticky tape to finish the work.</p><h2>4. Loosen leather shoes by blow-drying</h2><p class=align-left>Many of us could admit to buying a pair of shoes a size too small simply because they were on sale (a bargain is a bargain, right?). To stretch a pair of tight-fitting shoes, stick on a pair of thick socks, squeeze the shoes on your feet and blow dry especially tight areas on a high heat until they loosen up. This trick works best on leather or other natural materials.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1b524fb8024e3fad.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rapper Kanye West to give back his music artistes 50% of their masters</span></p></a><h2>5.
