He did a stellar job dressing her for both the recent&nbsp;Dune and&nbsp;Spider-Man press tours, and for their latest endeavour he put her in luxury brands like Burberry, Bvlgari, Givenchy, Schiaparelli, Coperni, Saint Laurent, Loewe, and Courreges, just to name a few.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the accompanying interview, the Oakland-born starlet opened up to interviewer Colman Domingo about finding her purpose in life, among other things. “I don’t necessarily have a plan. I’ve never really thought, ‘I have to do this by this time and I want to do this by that time.’ I just want to do the things that make me happy and bring me joy and fulfill me as an artist, as a person,” she said, later revealing that that she has a dream of directing “a simple love story about two Black girls.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“I don’t want it to be rooted in anything other than just a story about two people falling in love and that’s it. Something simple and beautiful, that leaves you happy and wanting to fall in love yourself,” she told Domingo.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Hayley Hynes is the former Weekend Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop, she stepped down after two years in 2024 to pursue other creative opportunities but remains on staff part-time to cover music, gossip, and pop culture news.
