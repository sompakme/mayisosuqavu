Noah said he feels the backlash is only because some racists think Halle Bailey is not the perfect person to play Ariel because she is black. He said:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6bceb49bc0d53c04.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>An exclusive list of the best black comedians</span></p></a>"Once again, a bunch of internet racists is upset that a fictional character is being played by a black person. Honestly, I don’t know what the big deal is. Ya'll realise Nemo was black, too, right? Yeah, that whole movie was about a fish who can’t find his dad!"<p class=align-left>He also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">responded</a> to those who brought out the representation card by reminding them that Ariel is an imaginary character. He added:</p>"The story remains the same. It’s just that the Little Mermaid is now represented as a black woman, so stop being ridiculous. It’s imaginary. They both have tails, and they both have red hair. ‘She looks nothing like her, how do I even know that she’s a mermaid?"<h2>Trevor Noah reacts as The Daily Show bags 7 Emmy Awards</h2><p class=align-left>Trevor Noah's show The Daily Show received nominations for seven Emmy Awards, and the comedian couldn't keep calm.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/aaf9d4b2fc3941f9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who are the best actors of all time?</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=#>The popular show was nominated</a> for the Outstanding Variety Series, Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series, Outstanding Picture Editing For Variety Programming and Outstanding Technical Direction, Camerawork, and Video Control.</p><p class=align-left>According to Deadline, The Daily Show has received the most Emmy nominations since the South African star became host in 2015.</p><p>Source: <a href=#>Briefly.co.za</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGZqbGlognKAjK2pnq6fp3qvu8ChZKygkaeytHnToaaun5ipwG6%2BwJygrKxdl66kt8uaqqFlmJa5rbGMm5iipJWuerG4wLKgp59dorKzucCim2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
