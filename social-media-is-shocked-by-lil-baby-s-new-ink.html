Though one may expect that the chatter surrounds their new deal, users are <a href=# rel>weighing in</a> for a different reason. In the clip, Lil Baby appears to have gotten some new ink. He looks to have tattoos on both of his arms now, which is confusing to fans.

People with tattoos–<a href=# rel>to me you look like a thug.</a>"</p><p>Though some fans claim that Lil Baby's ink may be fake, several others have been sharing their feelings on social media as if they're real. While many are <a href=# rel>somewhat disappointed</a> that Lil Baby could have gone back on his claims, various users are in support of his decision. Others are somewhere in the middle, but still shocked that he apparently switched up.
