"Online, people were quite cruel, saying she was not a singer but a shouter," her grandpa told the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>.&nbsp;More trolling has ensued during her stint on&nbsp;America's Got Talent, but at least all of that was confined to the internet, unlike the shade that took place at her school.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href=#>The Sun</a>, Hadwin was targeted by "Â­envious school bullies" who couldn't stand the fact that she was on her way to becoming a star.&nbsp;"At school, people laugh at you," she said. "They're not used to people singing like me. I get called names. They say I sing like a boy." She admitted that dealing with the taunting can be challenging. "I try not to let it get to me and I just hope they're watching me now."&nbsp;</p><p>All that hate worries her parents. "It made me scared of the spotlight, but it's not my life, it's hers," said her mom. "If she's brave enough to ignore it, how can I not?"&nbsp;Her father added, "All big singers get haters. Look at Ed Sheeran. He had to delete his Twitter account because he couldn't cope with it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamthaoF3e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5wqisq6yemsZutMCdrqKmXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
