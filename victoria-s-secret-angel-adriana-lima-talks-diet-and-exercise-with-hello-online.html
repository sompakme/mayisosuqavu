"I eat everything I want on Christmas day," <a class=hm-link href=#>Adriana Lima</a>, the longest-serving angel, told <strong>HELLO! Online</strong>. "I really don't watch what I eat. It's not like you have Christmas every day!"We caught up with the Brazilian beauty at the brand's flagship store on New Bond Street, where Adriana had flown in to greet fans and talk all things Christmas.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/638896419d4f-adriana-z.jpg><p id=eXOAtvAZV47D data-wc=22>Elegant in all-black, the supermodel also revealed to us her best exercise tip and the most romantic gift she has ever received…</p><strong>I eat what I want on Christmas Day…</strong><p id=eJc0nPgaHVFH data-wc=32>I eat everything. I really don't watch what I eat. It's not like you have Christmas every day! You have one day, so you're allowed to go bad for that one day.</p><strong>I'm quite sensible with my diet the rest of the time…</strong><p id=ewG4W_xrw_4i data-wc=69>I eat a balanced diet. The secret is to watch your portions but I also work out a lot. Working out a lot isn't necessary but I am very active and my body can endure intense workouts. I love working out and food is a source of energy so it's very important. I also have two kids and they keep me pretty much in shape running around the house!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/aa21ef6f8b09-adriana-2-z.jpg> <strong>It's not easy to find time to exercise…</strong><p id=ehMA2TkMrMFz data-wc=39>But I have a great tip – I have a jumping rope in the house and I just do ten minutes of it whenever I can. You don't need to work out for hours, just ten minutes will do.</p><strong>I give my family a lot of lingerie for Christmas…</strong><p id=ecQlssK-InIX data-wc=40>In Brazil, we don't have Victoria's Secret and my family are all Victoria's Secret fans so I usually bring them back some lovely pieces. I love the Dream Angel diamond bra in red lace because it's very romantic and sexy.</p><strong>My engagement ring was the most romantic gift I have ever received…</strong><p id=e5rh6F4GbYtu data-wc=28>It was on my birthday that my husband proposed to me and it was definitely the best gift I could ever have asked for. It was so romantic.</p><strong>I love perfume…</strong><p id=eEM-hF5TBWov data-wc=31>It's something that helps give me confidence – when I work, when I'm having dinner with my friends or with my husband. The VS Secret Night perfume is provocative and glamorous.</p><strong>Watching the Victoria's Secret fashion show back was great…</strong><p id=eYocbrLUQFe2 data-wc=71>It was definitely my favourite show that Victoria's Secret has ever done! The outfits were all so beautiful and we had great performances from Taylor Swift, Fall Out Boy and Neon Jungle — the energy was great!The Victoria's Secret show is part of Christmas culture because the whole world — over one hundred countries — is watching. It raises the holiday spirit and it's really exciting to be a part of.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
