Moreland says she makes $21K a month but spends $14K on rent and other necessities. Meanwhile, she alleges that Wayans makes $200K a month and is more than able to pay child support. Wayans has not <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">publicly</a> responded to the allegations at this time.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, many fans have found the maternity photos that Moreland posted during her pregnancy. A man she claims to be the baby's father is present in the photo. However, he is facing away from the camera and is not tagged in the photo. Despite this, a number of Moreland's friends have claimed that the man is in fact Wayans.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-marlon-wayans-details-nsfw-fantasy-about-orange-is-the-new-black-star-taryn-manning-amid-affair-drama>Marlon Wayans Details NSFW Fantasy About Orange Is The New Black Star Taryn Manning Amid Affair Drama</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Elsewhere, Wayans had a bizarre reaction to the news that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">actress</a> Taryn Manning had rimmed a man amid an affair last year. "Damn, i been wanting her to lick my ass for years‚Ä¶ smh ‚Ä¶ she always had that ‚ÄúI‚Äôll lick you ass‚Äù look about her too üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ .. for real tho. @vladtv crazy for this one. Why is this a HEADLINE?! There so much wrong in this!!!! Is it the ass eating? Is it the ass eating of a married man?! Or is that the girl from 8 mile is no longer known for that because her ass eating ass has eclipsed her wonderful acting talents. Today confuses me so much. Back to laughing üòÇHustle and Flow, 8 mile don‚Äôt matter she eating married men bootyhole‚Ä¶." Wayans wrote on Instagram.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">First of all, bravo to this man for being this confident about sexual wants and desires. Marlon Wayans wants to get his ass ate and you know what? Good for him. However, secondly, Wayans also makes the perfect point - why is this a headline? Of course, when a story like this comes out, people are going to write about it. But Wayans essentially destroys the entire gossip media industry with this one Instagram caption. What is it about this story that makes it newsworthy? Is it the act? The fidelity? Or the fact that in 2023, a woman famous for movies dares to be open about her sex life. It's no secret that world is growing more sexually conservative.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Benjamin Mock (they/them) is a sports and culture writer working out of Philadelphia.
