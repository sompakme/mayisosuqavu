They are very nervous. It’s pretty rare you have a poor tour and then go to Vegas," the person said. Rather than $90 million, the source argued that somewhere between $600,000 to $650,000 for fewer shows would be a more realistic offer. Another source confirmed that a deal has yet to be signed and negotiations are still ongoing.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-jennifer-lopez-performs-on-tour-in-las-vegas>Jennifer Lopez Performs On Tour In Las Vegas</h2></span><p>LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - JUNE 15: Jennifer Lopez performs during a stop of her It's My Party tour at T-Mobile Arena on June 15, 2019, in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Now, a sequel to her 2002 project, This Is Me… Then. She confirmed after dropping the new album that she's considering retirement from music. “The truth is I don’t even know if I’ll ever make another album after this. It’s such the kind of quintessential kind of Jennifer Lopez J.Lo project and I really feel very fulfilled, so they really will be collector’s items at a certain point,” Lopez told ET. “Don’t tell Benny [Medina] that that’s what I’m thinking — this might be my last album ever. I feel like it’s the end of a kind of an era for me and the beginning of a new one, so I would never say never, but right now I feel like I really put my heart and soul into this and I’m very excited and it definitely took a lot out of me."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In other news, Lopez and her husband, Ben Affleck have been reportedly been <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">dealing with marital woes</a> in recent weeks.
