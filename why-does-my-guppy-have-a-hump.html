The three main things that will cause your guppy to have a bent spine are tuberculosis, scoliosis, and swim bladder disease. Fortunately, if your guppy is suffering from swim bladder disease, you may be able to help them.<h2>Why does my fish have a hump on its back?</h2>If a fish has a bent or curved spine, it is most likely infected with a Gram-positive mycobacteria (Mycobacterium marinum or M. fortuitum).

The deformity is most likely caused by multiple genes.<h2>3 Reasons Why Guppies Die</h2><p></p><h2>Is fish TB contagious to humans?</h2>Is Fish Tuberculosis Contagious to Humans?

This isn't a requirement, but it can make a huge difference. Being separated from the rest of the fish will reduce stress tremendously. Furthermore, it'll give the babies a fighting chance at survival.<h2>Can guppies breed with their siblings?</h2>Male guppies produce higher quality sperm when courting their sisters, which may hinder females' efforts to reduce inbreeding, according to new research.<h2>Why does my fish have a bump?</h2>Lymphocystis is a common iridovirus found in both freshwater and marine fish.

Unfortunately, there is no treatment, but the disease is self limited and does not cause any serious clinical signs.<h2>Why is there a lump on my fish?</h2>Neurofibromas are most commonly associated with goldfish. These nerve sheath tumors cause localized skin and fin lumps that can grow very large, fall off, and then regrow. They are benign tumors and do not cause the fish any distress other than temporary hydrodynamic resistance, increasing their drag while swimming.<h2>How do you euthanize a guppy?</h2>It is currently widely accepted that the most humane way to euthanize a sick guppy is to use clove oil. When a guppy is exposed to clove oil is sufficiently high quantities it first becomes unconscious before stopping breathing. Clove oil is considered the most humane way for home aquarists to euthanize a guppy.<h2>Why does my fish look deformed?</h2>Deformities in fish can be very alarming and unfortunately are often the result of viral infections or tumours which are not directly treatable. In much the same way as humans the best way to treat viral infections is to support the body's immune system which will fight of the problem.<h2>What causes scoliosis in fish?</h2>Spinal deformities in farmed fishes can be caused by nutritional deficiencies (vitamins C and E and some amino acids). Spinal deformities include: scoliosis - an abnormal lateral curve to the vertebral column. lordosis - an abnormal inward (forward) curvature of the vertebral column.<h2>What does a guppy do before giving birth?</h2>A few days before delivery, she develops a bulge below the gills, her outline becoming fairly square in this region, while the gravid spot has enlarged its area.<h2>Will guppies eat their babies?</h2>Yes, they do. Though guppies are one of the calmest breeds and are generally pretty peaceful, they often end up eating their fry. This weird and disturbing activity is termed as filial cannibalism.<h2>Should I separate pregnant guppies?</h2>It is recommended that a pregnant guppy be removed from the community tank, or isolated in a part of it, in order to give birth to her fry.<h2>Do guppies have babies all at once?</h2>Typically, the fry are delivered one at a time, although they may appear in quick succession with pauses between groups of babies.

Kits are available at most fish or pet stores and use a simple color coding system to help you determine how much nitrate is in the water.<h2>How do I reduce nitrate in my aquarium?</h2>Water changes: Performing regular water changes with water that has little or no nitrate will lower the overall nitrate level in the aquarium. If your local tap or well water is high in nitrate, using deionized water (DI) or reverse osmosis water (RO) can help keep nitrate levels low when doing a water change.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahsGacn5rAbrnYZp6uqKCueqmt1Z5kmmWYqrqx</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
