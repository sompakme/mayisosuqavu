Although there were teases and thoughts of her return, that hasn’t happened yet. <a href=#>After Masked Singer stint</a> and some skin cancer treatments, we are still waiting for Bliss’ return.</p><p>Alexa Bliss surprised fans as a member of the Masked Singer cast this year. A couple of days later,<a href=#> she updated fans with some skin cancer information</a>. She had to have treatments to get some spots removed, but she seems to be doing fine.</p><p><a href=#>Ringside News</a> asked around about Alexa Bliss, and we are told that her name hasn’t come up at all. She was around for WrestleMania, but she wasn’t used. Only time will tell when they bring her back.</p><p>A lot of fans thought that Alexa Bliss and Bray Wyatt would continue their story. <a href=#>There were also WrestleMania plans for Bliss</a>. Obviously, that didn’t happen, because Bray Wyatt is still absent from WWE television with no sign of his return in sight.</p><p>We will have to keep waiting for Alexa Bliss’ name to come up again. This is an interesting time with the WWE Draft approaching, so hopefully, fans will get some new information about her soon.</p><p>What’s your take on Alexa Bliss’ current situation with WWE?

These two things drive me. Years of experience in writing, journalism, and digging exclusive insider info for Ringside News. Worked in finance before realizing pro wrestling journalism made much less sense. Pro beachballs at pro wrestling shows, pro dives if someone catches, anti bullies, olives, and pineapples on pizza.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX90e49tZmpxX5eupXnNnq6sZZakv26ty56vmmWSoba0v4yipKadlJ6utbGMn6ytraKaeqq6jLCunmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
