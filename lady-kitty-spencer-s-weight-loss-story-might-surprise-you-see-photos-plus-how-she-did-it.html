There was no emphasis on size – that's not what it's about at all."</p><p id=e7r_e17j_Ijs data-wc=74>Before that, in 2010, she told the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Evening Standard</a> that exercise and healthy eating just weren't for her. "There's a gym in the house, literally next door to my bedroom," she said. "I've walked past and looked in but I've never been inside. I don't like exercise, so I don't do it. Many girls my age have a weight obsession but I haven't – it's too boring to bother trying to keep thin, life's too short."</p><p id=eLM2GiwWvLWa data-wc=22>She didn't agree with weighing herself, either. "My mum says it's unhealthy having scales in the house – they're banned," she explained.</p><p id=et_famWu_fc- data-wc=77>It's both her mother, Victoria Aitken, and late aunt, Princess Diana that have shaped the way she perceives health and fitness nowadays, too. In an interview with Harper's Bazaar in 2019, Lady Kitty Spencer revealed that Diana's battle with bulimia and her mother's struggles with anorexia and drug and alcohol addiction have made her realise the importance of both physical and mental wellbeing. Here's everything she does to keep on top of both her body and brain.</p><h2>Lady Kitty Spencer exercises regularly</h2><p id=evXAaau3Xxzq data-wc=14>Speaking to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Harper's Bazaar</a>, she revealed she's a big fan of spin and barre classes.</p><h2>Lady Kitty Spencer maintains a routine</h2><p id=edygyrq0_RIE data-wc=23>She also likes to stay fit on holiday, and previously shared this snap after climbing Sydney Harbour Bridge during a trip to Australia.</p><h2>Lady Kitty Spencer doesn't restrict herself</h2><p id=ez3zJioZ5KrN data-wc=21>She's all about balance, and truffle pizza is her go-to treat. "It's all just melted cheese - it's heaven," she said.</p><h2>Lady Kitty Spencer doesn't compare herself to others</h2><p id=eQgcDB_-9HbD data-wc=79>She appreciates that every body is unique, and she doesn't try and change herself for work, either. "I don't think it's my job to starve to fit into an outfit," she explained. "If I've agreed to do something for a brand or whatever, I look after myself but I'm not obsessive or unhealthy. If a brand wants to work with me, and think their designs look good on me, then they can give them to me in my size."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=eQQYfmpwCBEV data-wc=5>We applaud you, Lady Kitty.</p><p id=eJYxFynlPiII data-wc=23><strong>Make sure you never miss a ROYAL story! <a class=hm-link href=#>Sign up to our newsletter</a> to get all of our celebrity, royal and lifestyle news delivered directly to your inbox.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaJ%2BemZyptW6tzZ1kn6Gko7K0v45rZ2tpYG5%2FeH2Ra21sa1%2BhrqXFjKSgraypYsCxsc2cnKtloKe2r6%2FErKpmnJmWu6J5zaKcnJ1drLKqs8etZKWno6h6sbTOraasZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
