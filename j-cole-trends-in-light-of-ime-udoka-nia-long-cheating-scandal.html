To make matters worse, Udoka is in a relationship with Nia Long, who was his biggest supporter during the NBA Finals. He cheated on her, and now,&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">he is a laughing stock amongst NBA fans on Twitter.</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In light of this news, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>J. Cole</a> has begun trending on Twitter. As many of you know, Cole rapped about Long on "No Role Modelz" where he said, "<span class="ReferentFragmentdesktop__Highlight-sc-110r0d9-1 jAzSMw">My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet</span>/<span class="ReferentFragmentdesktop__Highlight-sc-110r0d9-1 jAzSMw">My only regret was too young for Nia Long</span>."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Fans on Twitter are now making jokes about Cole's involvement in all of this and how he could very well be gearing up to slide into Long's DMs. As you can see in the various tweets below, fans came through with some pretty hilarious memes which just go to show that Twitter users are always ready for the latest scandal.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Some people even generated theories about how all of the women that Cole has rapped about are now leaving serious relationships. Of course, this is simply a joke, but it is a coincidence that some find to be amusing.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The Ime Udoka-Nia Long saga is one that will likely continue throughout the weekend.
