Overall, he is one of those guys that can make his teams immediately better. Unfortunately, he has dealt with quite a few injury issues over the course of his career. This week, the injury issues persisted as he was warming up in Phoenix. It was a big game for him as this was his first in Arizona. However, he never got to actually play as he slipped while going for a layup. <a href=# rel>He twisted his ankle on the play</a>, and he was subsequently sidelined from the match.</p><p>In the end, it wasn't too bad for the Phoenix Suns as they were able to win the game by a score of 132-101 against the OKC Thunder. Regardless, this is one of those injuries that could destroy the Suns' title hopes. Many have theorized that KD could be out for the rest of the season, including the start of the playoffs. Consequently, the Suns have been ripped of their "title favorites" designation. Luckily, the injury doesn't seem to be as bad as reported.</p><span><h2 id=h-kevin-durant-prognosis>Kevin Durant Prognosis</h2></span><p>According to Shams Charania of The Athletic, Durant will be re-evaluated in about two weeks' time. He has a left ankle sprain, and the swelling has already gone down. Overall, these are all good signs that should excite Suns fans. However, Durant could still wind up missing more time. His ability to get back on the court will hinge on his rehab and whether or not it goes well. Durant is someone who has been injured quite a bit over the years, so this could prove to be a difficult task.</p><p>At this point, the Suns feel as though they cannot catch a break. That said, they are comfortably in a playoff spot and based on this news, it seems like KD should be back in time for a postseason run. With Durant in the lineup, they are 3-0 which is certainly reason to be excited. Hopefully, he can recover quickly and get back out there.
