Specifically, the borough's officials asked that if onlookers wanted to throw flowers, they only throw one each, with any wrapping or packaging removed.

Diana's coffin was also topped with wreaths. Another <a href=#>Metro</a> article reported that the events surrounding the queen's funeral reminded Prince William of <a href=#>his mother's</a>. Particularly, walking behind the queen's coffin as it was taken to Westminster Hall was sadly similar.
