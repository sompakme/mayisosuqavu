So, when a friend told me that she had gotten high from soaking in a THC-infused bath bomb, my ears perked up. I figured if I could combine two of the things I treasure the most, my quality of life would soar.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Needless to say, I hopped on that. Faster than you can say one, two, three, and I was soaking in my tub with Kush Queen's CBD & Delta-8 THC's bath bomb fizzling around me. But before I get more into it, let me explain exactly what Delta-8 is, for those who don't know.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Delta-8 is THC, but doesn't get you stoned. It's like "light" weed high if you will. But, as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>we previously reported</a>, it has more of a punch than your go-to CBD gummy. If you ask me, that sounds like the ideal ingredient to have in a bath bomb, especially if you have to do your skincare routine and a load of laundry afterward.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kush Queen's site explains that the reason users can feel the effects of Delta-8 in this form is that our skin is the body's largest organ and, as such, it's a powerful tool for absorbing cannabinoids and balancing your endocannabinoid system. The brand suggests soaking in the tub for at least 20 minutes to feel its effects.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kush Queen&nbsp;</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After waiting that period, I did begin to notice that my body felt way more relaxed than it typically does when I use regular bath salts or bombs. My mind felt like I had had two glasses of red wine â€” not tipsy, but less uptight and happier.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kush Queen offers four varieties of its 1:1 CBD & Delta-8 bath bombs: Sleep, Relax, Shield, and Relieve. So far, I've tried the Sleep and Relax ones and have been very happy with both. I work out about four times a week, so aside from loving the Delta-8 aspect, my sore muscles really appreciate the CBD in the formula as well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZL2zu8Oumq2rXam8sLjSaKKuq5hivraxxKdknZ2cqa5uhIycmZ1lkpbBqXnBqKSb</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
