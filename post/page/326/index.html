The 72-year-old widower from Indiana is searching for a second chance at love with one of 22 women, and let me be the first to say—they’re all gorgeous.
Of course, Gerry is old enough and wise enough to know that looks aren’t everything. These women, all of whom are over 60, have lived lives filled with friendship, careers, children, lovers, and even loss, and they have the stories and smile lines to prove it. <a href=../../../see-5-golden-bachelor-contestants-when-they-were-young.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../the-19-best-long-lasting-fragrances-of-2024.html>The 19 Best Long-Lasting Fragrances of 2024</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>
