He was also part of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre match last week on Dynamite. Now it appears Jarrett claimed AEW made way more than $100K for the match.</p><p>On the August 16 edition of AEW Dynamite, the company presented the Texas Chainsaw Massacre match, featuring Jeff Jarrett vs Jeff Hardy. The bout was a violent affair and it even featured an appearance from Leatherface himself,&nbsp;<a href=#>who turned out to be Dean Alexander</a>.</p><p>The match was a tie-in for the upcoming video game of the same name. Dave Meltzer reported that AEW made <a href=#>over $100,000 in sponsorship</a> with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre match.</p><p>While speaking on his My World podcast on <a href=#>AdFreeShows.com</a>, Jeff Jarrett addressed the report that AEW earned $100K in sponsorship for the match. Jarrett claimed that AEW earned way more than that.</p><p>“The sponsor’s exact words, ‘Incredible. Way over delivered.’ Okay, so that’s a win. It’s my understanding across the board, the network, because they’re the ones that, you know, I guess they now have, and you know, it’s not that this is the first and certainly it’s not going to be the last, but you know, when you build a deck and hey, ‘We did this for this client, this for this client, all that’, obviously it goes without saying the top man, T.K., super excited, and look, his sole decision. That was up to him. When the funds are going to Maui, that kind of says so much to me, but the audience being so passionate about it, I love that, okay, that lit a nerve. Not always good. Some people just didn’t like it, but I loved it.</p><p>I thought it was an honor to be in that type of integration. It was definitely out of the box. I thought Jeff Hardy and his entire crew, you can say executed it to a tee. I’m not a horror movie guy, but Leatherface, that clip of him walking down the aisle and throwing the chainsaw and he was supposed to be on our side, but Sonjay got his ass kicked, Karen got ran off, and all the integration, just look at the images in the background, production, across the board, it was a grand slam in so many ways.</p><p>For those that didn’t like this kind of stuff, I will say this without question. It certainly will make you appreciate, more, your four and five star matches. So yes, it actually served a purpose to you as well. It will make you appreciate, ‘Hey, I don’t like that, that integration stuff. I like this stuff.’ So I’m super excited that, mission accomplished.</p><p>Just to let you in on this, the number that’s being reported online, that’s why I haven’t commented on it, it’s way low. It blew me away.”</p><p>What’s your view on the Texas Chainsaw Massacre match? Did you like it?
