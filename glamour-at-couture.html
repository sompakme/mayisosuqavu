Both happenings offered fashion propositions anchored in theatrics and costume, around the dualities of glamour as they exist now, in a time when the vernacular of personal style is muddied by internet-born <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/a46493231/mob-wife-aesthetic-trend-explained/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=“aesthetics” class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">“aesthetics”</a> (or dressing according to a theme, rather than cultivating one’s own look). There’s been a ton of red-carpet character dressing over the last year or so—the Swans, Barbiecore, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a45682967/cailee-spaeny-priscilla-interview-2023/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Priscilla class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Priscilla</a> hair—and in many cases, personas have overtaken personality. Self-expression aside, this all asks the question: Does unadulterated glamour still exist in an age when glamorous style means dressing for a previous era, like wearing opera gloves, pillbox hats, and ball skirts? That’s all fun, but one wonders what the future of glamour looks like minus the camp.</p><img alt="schiaparelli couture spring 2024 runway" title="Schiaparelli Couture Spring 2024 - Runway" width=683 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/model-on-the-runway-at-schiaparelli-couture-spring-2024-as-news-photo-1706463629.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">WWD</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Space-goddess glamour at Schiaparelli</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The best couture collections this season offered a few answers. There were magical new ideas for dressing with a kind of power and contemporary glamour, even if it was placed into a fantastical narrative or borrowed heavily from the past. At Schiaparelli, Daniel Roseberry did sci-fi glam by way of Sigourney Weaver in Alien, with not-of-this-world anatomical shapes and CD-ROM-ified embellishments. It was classic Schiap surrealism with a tech bend, not just in the robot baby carried down the runway by Maggie Maurer, but also with clothes that exemplified the highest art of tailoring, like the doll-like ballooned sleeves on tops and gowns with shoulders and necklines sculpted to look like the rolling landscapes in Dune. At Fendi, Kim Jones too looked to unknown galaxies for inspiration, delivering a collection that was sharp and sophisticated—a cool and sexy kind of glamour that might move us all to infinity and beyond.</p><img alt="jean paul gaultier by simone rocha runway paris fashion week haute couture springsummer 2024" title="Jean Paul Gaultier by Simone Rocha - Runway - Paris Fashion Week - Haute Couture Spring/Summer 2024" width=2837 height=4256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sora-choi-walks-the-runway-during-the-jean-paul-gaultier-by-news-photo-1706463716.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Victor Virgile</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>One of Simone Rocha’s empowered coquettes</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Those bionic women were a stark but brilliant contrast to the spectacularly deranged dames at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/designers/a46520647/simone-rocha-jean-paul-gaultier-couture-collection-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jean Paul Gaultier’s show, which saw Simone Rocha" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Jean Paul Gaultier’s show, which saw Simone Rocha</a> presenting her guest collection for the house. It was an epic mash-up of two of the industry’s most beloved and forward-thinking designers, one a man whose iconic cone bras and sailor stripes gave way to an entire generation of liberated dressers, the other a woman whose romantic, skillful designs have garnered a cult following. The collection was powerful and precise but totally un-precious—a formula that can be difficult to achieve with couture, a rarified craft practice in fashion made only for celebrities and the one percent. Details (including red tulle, horn-shaped bodices, unraveling corsets, and crystal fringe) felt like a coquette fantasia, one that was not about going back to girlhood but rather finding strength in one’s own sexual freedom. There was a well-balanced array of costume-y creations and classic day- and eveningwear, pieces that could be worn by either matriarch or daughter at a bacchanal on the grounds of the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/red-carpet-dresses/g46409716/rosamund-pike-saltburn-press-run-red-carpet-style/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Saltburn class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Saltburn</a> estate.</p><img alt="valentino runway paris fashion week haute couture springsummer 2024" title="Valentino : Runway - Paris Fashion Week - Haute Couture Spring/Summer 2024" width=2001 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/model-walks-the-runway-during-the-valentino-haute-couture-news-photo-1706463910.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Marc Piasecki</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>A fantastical, yet oddly practical (who doesn’t love a nice trouser?) look at Valentino</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Another display of generational glamour was on display in the front row at Valentino, where <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a46524010/kylie-jenner-stormi-paris-fashion-week-matching-looks/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kylie Jenner turned up" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Kylie Jenner turned up</a> to the show with mom Kris and daughter Stormi Webster in tow. The Jenner clan exemplifies another kind of 2024-era glamour, one that might be manufactured but is also about being bold and successful—and, weirdly, relatable. When Pierpaolo Piccioli’s collection came down the runway, there was a similarly empowering aura to it all, and that same strange relatability. His couture this season wasn’t necessarily about statement-making art, though there were plenty of incredible, potential award-season gowns on display. Instead, it was about couture as wardrobe. Some of the most impactful looks were those that gave us dreamlike versions of our everyday garb, like oversize cargo parkas paired with sheer tees and rounded-pleat ball skirts. There were trenches thrown easily over sensual draped dresses with thigh-high slits, and classic trousers in bright hues paired with exquisitely made embellished ponchos and coats.</p><img alt="a model in a white alaia couture minidress with a bubble hem" title="Alaia Couture Spring 2024" width=2732 height=4098 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/alaia-sf24-look-front-01-65b693c7b8804.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Photo: Filippo Fior / Gorunway.com</span><p>Alaïa built an entire collection out of one kind of yarn.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a similar act of focus on the clothes, Alaïa’s Pieter Mulier and his team took a single wool yarn and created a stunningly simplistic but entrancing collection that was about the intimacy and the art of couture. It was in this show that one saw a possible segue for this highly commercialized moment of glamour we’re living in. Mulier recognizes and harnesses the strength in a woman and the way she wears clothes. He emphasized curves and shapes and fluidity with pieces like a 3-D printed spiral gown, molded to the body like magic—there’s that word again—or a balloon-hem fringed minidress with surrealist anatomical proportions.</p><img alt="a model wears a corset and a sheer gown" title="A John Galliano Look for Margiela Couture Spring 2024" width=2732 height=4098 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/maison-margiela-artisanal-2024-look-28-65b6953a6aa49.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Giovanni Giannoni</span><p>John Galliano’s collection for Margiela was full of scene-stealing moments.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Then came the great <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/fashion-week/a46552616/john-galliano-maison-margiela-couture-spring-2024-show/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John Galliano" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">John Galliano</a>. In the audience, the industry’s most illustrious critics and editors were visibly googly-eyed, some smiling with their mouths wide open, they’d been electroshocked back to the realization that, yes, there is still magic—and therefore glamour—in fashion. The performance element of this collection was brilliant, but more impactful was the return of Galliano’s unbridled assuredness, a confidence to go full-steam with his singular vision, even if it felt like a blast from the past. You saw it in the ballooned panniers, the prosthetics that took a year to craft, and the cheeky faux pubic-hair merkins that shone through delicately painted sheer slips. It was in the model’s gestures and the way they slinked and creaked and cracked like Victorian dolls come to life, some in corsets and others in skirts with exaggerated hips, moving through the darkened space beneath a bridge in Paris meant to evoke a local cafe as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/person/103KE9 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Brassaï class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Brassaï</a> might have captured it. There was lace and latex, sex and darkness and dilapidation. To close, actor Gwendoline Christie sauntered out with a glassy face—makeup was by the genius Pat McGrath—like a woman occupying both living and dead worlds.</p><img alt="a person in a white dress" title="Gwendoline Christie in full vamp mode for Margiela Couture 2024" width=2732 height=4098 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/maison-margiela-artisanal-2024-look-44-65b695ddaba0c.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Giovanni Giannoni</span><p>Gwendoline Christie in full vamp mode for Margiela</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Galliano essentially took all the good ideas presented throughout the week and mashed them up into something great. He whipped them into a character study of modern glamour, one that can exist in whatever form the wearer wants but should always be born out of something inherent. Most importantly, Galliano was honest in his celebration of the female form, casting a range of sizes that was otherwise completely absent from the week, save for a few of the models at Rocha’s show for Jean Paul Gaultier. While couture is singular in so many ways (and certainly isn’t inclusive in terms of the pool of people who get to buy and wear these creations), it does serve as inspiration and therefore should reflect the whole of global fashion, as far as women’s bodies and needs and wants are concerned.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As Galliano explained in his show notes, his couture collection was predominantly “a study in the ritual of dressing as a composition of the self.” What a profoundly important message to promote at a time when all of us are constantly bombarded by various modes of glamour, often the kind that tells us we need to become someone else or something better. The future of glamour is that it doesn’t have to be one thing or another, so long as we find the magic in it for ourselves.<br></p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/lettermark.934d28d.svg?primary=%2523000" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=100 width=100 alt=Lettermark style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Brooke Bobb is the fashion news director at Harper’s Bazaar, working across print and digital platforms.
