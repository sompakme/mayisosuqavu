Last year, this <a href=#>part of the ceremony </a>was hosted by Darren Criss and Julianne Hough.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The televised ceremony was split in two for the first time in fall 2021, when the pandemic-delayed ceremony for the 2019-2020 awards was held. At the time, Audra McDonald and Leslie Odom Jr. split hosting duties for the four-hour event, with the first two hours, streaming on Paramount+, containing the bulk of the awards. The following two hours celebrated the return to Broadway, after theaters had been closed during the pandemic, and presented the biggest awards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The move to Pluto comes as FAST streaming services gain in popularity and become an important complement to many networks existing paid streaming services. In September, Paramount’s Pluto TV <a href=#>became the first free, ad-supported</a> platform to crack the Nielsen Gauge, reaching 1 percent of all TV viewership in the U.S. for the month.
