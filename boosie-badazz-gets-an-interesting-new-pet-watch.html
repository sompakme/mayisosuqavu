In a tweet, he <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">announced that he was cancer-free</a> and attributed his recovery to the grace of God. However, he also acknowledged that his faith had been tested during his battle with cancer. Sadly, the rapper's joy was tempered by some unfortunate news that he received at the same time. In the same tweet, Boosie revealed that his cancer doctor had passed away since their last meeting. This news must have come as a shock to Boosie, who likely felt a strong connection with his doctor during his treatment. It is not clear how long it had been since Boosie last saw his doctor, but the fact that he was not informed of his passing until after his recovery is certainly a difficult pill to swallow.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The Louisiana native took some time to say some kind words about the late doctor. “Thank [you], Dr. Wood, for always making me laugh when I was down. [You] were the best,” Boosie said. “I remember you rubbin my head when I was cryin before surgery. You ask me why I was crying n I told U I was thinkin about all the wrong I’ve done n my life n you said Mr. Boosie, God forgives.” It appears that Dr. Wood’s kind encouragement will stick with Boosie even though the doctor has passed. Now, Boosie is taking time to enjoy life a little bit.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-boosie-s-new-friend>Boosie's New Friend</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Boosie Badazz is a really interesting character. Oftentimes, he comes across as somewhat callous and cold. He says things that could be considered <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">homophobic or hateful.</a> However, at the same time, he appears to be a very caring and loving person. In a new video posted on Boosie's Instagram stories, he showed off his new pet: a tiny duckling. In the video, Boosie dubs the little guy "Lil Boosie" and "Boosie The Duck." He calls the animal the newest addition to the estate and tells him how much he loves him. He then helps him into the pool so he can swim around.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It's a very charming video from a very unexpected source. It seems like beating cancer is making Boosie a little bit softer in the right ways. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">He's still not afraid to express his opinion</a>, though. Still, it's nice to see a softer side of Boosie as he interacts with his new pet. What do you think of Boosie The Duck?
