And I think that we should all be super-thrilled to make it," Sharon told <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">The Times&nbsp;</a>in the UK. "Because I’ve witnessed any number of people not making it." "I think that people who are embarrassed about being older are just stupid and ungrateful," she continued.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a7c246c7b2d6-sharon-stone-pfw.jpg><p id=ebDjuC0NIA data-wc=68>But her decision to celebrate life hasn't come out of nowhere; at the age of 42 Sharon faced a near-death experience when a ruptured vertebral artery caused internal bleeding in her brain for nine days.
