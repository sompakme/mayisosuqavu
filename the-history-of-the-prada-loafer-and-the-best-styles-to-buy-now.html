Now a style stalwart, the chunky-soled, plaque-adorned shoe felt both refreshingly practical and comfortingly familiar.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/what-to-wear/g38959502/best-loafers/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=loafer class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">loafer</a> certainly wasn’t a new addition to Miuccia Prada’s box of tricks; it had been a regular feature on the house’s catwalks in the ‘90s and ‘00s. But its revival came at the right time, with both Covid-induced lockdowns and the ensuing hybrid-working model sounding the death knell for heels. We collectively agreed: no more tottering.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s widely acknowledged that Miuccia Prada invented ‘Ugly Chic’, an aesthetic most famously epitomised by Prada’s spring/summer 1996 collection entitled ‘Banal Eccentricity’. It was a radical embracing of 1970s prints, awkward colour combinations and librarian-worthy silhouettes. On foot? The loafer’s gawky sibling – the lace-up brogue. These were “the kind of shoes women could run in,” wrote Susannah Frankel in Prada Catwalk (Thames Hudson, 2019).</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><img alt="prada loafers" title="Street Style - Paris Fashion Week - Haute Couture Fall/Winter 2021/2022 : Day One" width=3493 height=5239 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/giovanna-battaglia-wears-black-sunglasses-a-silver-and-news-photo-1676459516.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Edward Berthelot</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This wasn’t Prada’s first flirtation with unsexy shoes. The hero of this piece, the loafer – albeit in a more understated guise – first appeared in Prada’s spring/summer 1991 show, as part of Miuccia’s sixth collection for the house. These were sleek and logo-less, ornamented only by a few stitches in contrasting thread. The loafer’s regular reprisals – tapered and metallic in 1992; chunky and jewel-hued in 1999; glossy and preppy in 2005 – cemented it as a brand signature of sorts, alongside the Mary Jane or the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/what-to-wear/a40543946/prada-nylon-bags/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="nylon Vela backpack" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">nylon Vela backpack</a>, at least throughout the 1990s and 2000s.</p><img alt="street style" title="Street Style - September 2022 - New York Fashion Week" width=1024 height=683 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fashion-week-guest-seen-wearing-a-white-dress-outside-peter-news-photo-1676459836.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jeremy Moeller</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Prada catwalks remained relatively loafer-less until 2020, when the house unveiled its most conspicuous version of the shoe yet. One can suppose its arrival came off the back of the Y2K revival, which saw fashion lovers flocking to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/what-to-wear/news/a34512/the-best-designer-resale-sites/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="resale sites" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">resale sites</a> to snag vintage Prada loafers as well as nylon bags and backpacks, both of which were officially re-issued in 2019 and 2020 respectively.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Chocolate loafer was a larger-than-life take on the classic penny style, crafted from glossy leather and equipped with a sizeable sole, tapered toe and thick strap. Its crowning glory? The label’s recognisable triangle-shaped plaque. It featured the House of Savoy coat of arms, a symbol that’s been incorporated in the Prada logo since 1919, when the house was appointed Official Supplier to the Italian Royal Household.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><img alt="bella hadid" title="Celebrity Sightings In New York City - December 13, 2020" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bella-hadid-is-seen-in-soho-on-december-13-2020-in-new-york-news-photo-1676459290.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If the Nineties resurgence and lockdown heel-phobia wasn’t recipe enough for the loafer’s success, the shoe was officially legitimised by the holy trinity – or rather, quaternity – of modern style: Bella, Gigi, Kendall and Hailey, who wore their Prada loafers with white ankle socks and mini skirts and oversized jackets, or ‘90s jeans and baby tees. A special mention goes to Danish influencer Pernille Teisbaek, whose leather blazer and loafer look has been shared, pinned and recreated hundreds of thousands of times over.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For a while, the Prada loafer was practically ungettable, unless you were lucky enough to make it to the top of a very long waiting list. Luckily, Prada brought it back the following season, and the season after that, and the season after that, in both its original form and fresh new guises: foiled in high-shine metallics, stacked upon the heavy-tread Monolith platform, or liberally studded with crystals.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The anti-sexy shoe that had won our lockdown-wearied, Prada-archive-loving hearts has become a modern classic, giving new meaning to the term ‘Banal Eccentricity’. It’s comfortable (requiring little to no wearing in) and it looks good with everything from baggy jeans and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/what-to-wear/news/g23460/blazers/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=blazers class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">blazers</a> to voluminous tulle dresses. We say, long live the loafer.</p><img alt="prada loafer" title="The Hill House Home UK Launch Dinner At The Ochre Restaurant, The National Gallery" width=683 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prada-loafer-649d79503176d.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Darren Gerrish</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Best dressed at the 2024 Oscars after-parties" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/hbz-oscarsap-thumb-1-65ef1fc4b0b2c.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSudX6YaW9ucGZkvbOtw5pkpaeRm7Kzv44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
