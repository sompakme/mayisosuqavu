After starting a movement to get his face on the mural outside of Pro Wrestling Tees with “Pepsi Man,” the company finally acquiesced, and he now has his face in a prominent spot above the likeness of Punk. The pair’s playful banter came to a head as they were both scheduled to appear at the C2E2 convention in Chicago.</p><p>On Punk’s Instagram story, he shared a photo of Danhausen that he says he used to get him thrown out of the show. The pic was captioned by Punk, noting that Danhausen had made a grave mistake. In the photo, Danhausen is sitting next to four cans of Coke Zero.</p><p>“Just spoke to the office, and got him kicked out of c2e2 for tomorrow”</p><p>The very nice, very evil Danhausen responded, claiming that he was framed by The Second City Saint. He stated that he’ll be back Sunday with a vengeance. Fans who planned to visit Danhausen on Saturday would’ve been disappointed anyway. He was only ever <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">booked to appear on Friday and Sunday</a>. It was all in good fun.</p><p>The lighthearted exchange can only increase Danhausen’s already massive level of fame. It’s likely that he will spend his Saturday counting human money, organizing his teeth, and preparing to travel home in his blimp. CM Punk is slated to appear all three days, however.</p><p>It’s an interesting time for Danhausen. After breaking his leg at an independent show on Halloween, he’s stayed active on the convention circuit and through his YouTube channel. As his popularity continues to grow, fans have heavily speculated that once healed, Danhausen will eventually turn up in AEW. Time will tell if Tony Khan will respond to the message Danhausen left for him at the AEW office’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">outside voicemail communicator</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><strong>What do you think of the relationship between Danhausen and CM Punk?
