Today, we've decided to honor him by taking a peak at some of his lesser-known cuts.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Tupac left behind an incredible body of work. So much, in fact, that he's released seven posthumous albums since his passing. There's been some massive hits, like "Until The End Of Time" and "Thugz Mansion," but also some gems that didn't really get any mainstream love. We're focusing on those joints today. Without any further ado, here's a Throwback Thursday dedicated to 2Pac's deep cuts.</p><p><br><h2>2Pac - Soulja's Story</h2></p><p>#TBT: 2Pac's Deep Cuts</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Tupac raps as two characters here: himself and Soulja. The first verse, Soulja's, is toned down like chopped & screwed music, so if you've ever wanted to hear 2Pac with some Houston flavor, look no further.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>2Pac - Point The Finga</h2></p><p>#TBT: 2Pac's Deep Cuts</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">You can tell that this is an old school cut just by the style, but Big D The Impossible crafted a pretty futuristic beat for 1993. It's funky, fresh, and a solid dose of 90s hip hop.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>Thug Life - Str8 Ballin'</h2></p><p>#TBT: 2Pac's Deep Cuts</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Thug Life was a group Tupac started in '93. In addition to himself, it featured&nbsp;Big Syke, Stretch, Mopreme Shakur, The Rated R, Macadoshis, and Kato. While they only&nbsp;released one album, <strong>Thug Life: Volume 1</strong>,&nbsp;their name is a huge part of Pac's legacy.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>2Pac -&nbsp;Heaven Ain't Hard 2 Find</h2></p><p>#TBT: 2Pac's Deep Cuts</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">If you made it to the end of Tupac's classic double album&nbsp;<strong>All Eyes on Me</strong>, then you know about this one. If not, get acquainted, because this is some more of that classic Pac.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>2Pac -&nbsp;Heavy in the Game (feat.

While&nbsp;he experimented with a variety of production, this one is funky as hell, and features some of his lesser-known pals.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>2Pac - Black Jesuz (feat.

"Searchin' for Black Jesuz..."&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>2Pac - Nothing To Lose</h2></p><p>#TBT: 2Pac's Deep Cuts</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The second posthumous album from 2Pac was 1997's 26-track double album&nbsp;<strong>R U Still Down? (Remember Me)</strong>. The upbeat track "Nothing To Lose" was just one of the many great records on it.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>2Pac - Lil Homies</h2></p><p>#TBT: 2Pac's Deep Cuts</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">2001's <strong>Until The End Of Time&nbsp;</strong>was a high profile posthumous release from Tupac. The double album had the huge title track, but it also had some great deep cuts like "Lil Homies."&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>2Pac - How Do You Want It&nbsp;(Live at The House of Blues)&nbsp;</h2></p><p>#TBT: 2Pac's Deep Cuts</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Live albums aren't exactly as popular in hip hop as they are in other types of music. However, 2Pac's <strong>Live at the House of Blues</strong>&nbsp;proves our subject was a great concert to see.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p>#TBT: 2Pac's Deep Cuts</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Statik Selektah pieced together this tribute to a few of hip hop's fallen soldiers. It's nice to hear Pun, L, Biggie, and Pac all on the same track, even if it's unfortunate circumstances that united them.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdjaH96g4ytma1lYqWupL%2BMnZyeqF2YwrW%2FjKecsKs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
