Leggings are the pants that are always there for you when you need them, like during big meals or after a long day of work in jeans. Not to mention, leggings are the most effortless and comfy bottoms aside from sweatpants, and you can do anything in them—from working out to lounging on the couch.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s no wonder, then, that the internet has an&nbsp;obsession with the best leggings, especially the five-star leggings available on Amazon. It turns out that the e-commerce giant has much more than home goods and gadgets—it also offers a massive selection of affordable leggings in just about every color, material, and style you can imagine, from <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/g31903281/best-black-leggings/>black leggings</a> to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/g34975882/leggings-with-pockets/>leggings with pockets</a>. To help narrow down your search for the best leggings on Amazon, we've combed through the pairs with the best ratings and reviews.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-to-look-for-in-leggings><span>What to Look For in Leggings</span></h2><p>With so many <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/g32369050/best-activewear-brands/>activewear brands</a> on the market, it all comes down to personal preference when it's time to shop for a pair of leggings, says <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.zoejanemitchell.com/about referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Zoë Mitchell</a>, a yoga and fitness instructor based in Miami. If you're working out, Mitchell says to look out for keywords like <strong>“moisture-wicking,” “breathable,” “four-way stretch,”&nbsp;and&nbsp;“supportive,”</strong> adding, "Most leggings are typically something like 80 percent polyester or nylon and 20 percent elastane or spandex." One thing to keep in mind, however, is that "breathable" fabrics tend to be less supportive, but, again, Mitchell stresses that leggings are personal.&nbsp;</p><p>"My preference isn’t based on the material but on the brand and how I’m feeling that day," says Mitchell. For example, if she's wanting to look stylish, she turns to a fashion-forward brand like <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-us/shop/designer/alo-yoga referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&mid=24449&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.net-a-porter.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdesigner%2Falo-yoga" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=net-a-porter.com data-merchant-id=201801 data-merchant-url=net-a-porter.com data-merchant-network=LS>Alo</a> or <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://setactive.co/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Set Active</a>. She also likes to base her leggings around her cycle. "If I’m dealing with PMS bloat, I’m going to choose a more supportive legging that offers some compression, or if I’m on my period, something comfy and breathable." All in all, Mitchell says the most important thing when it comes to leggings is feeling good in what you wear.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-best-leggings-on-amazon><span>The Best Leggings on Amazon</span></h2><a href=# data-model-name="CRZ YOGA Naked Feeling High Waist Yoga Tights " data-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DCSM69V referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07DCSM69V%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id=1471 data-merchant-url=amazon.com data-merchant-network=Amazon readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5kqfzhTD3BHV6jdQcvzA46-1920-80.jpeg><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Overall Leggings on Amazon</span></p></a><p>CRZ YOGA Naked Feeling High Waist Yoga Tights</p><p>The name of this pair from CRZ YOGA says it all: You'll feel like you have nothing on (in a good way) while you wear them.

First, the pros: they're affordable (prices range from $18 and up depending on the color you choose), comfortable, and stretchy. Also, fitness bloggers like Whitney Simmons have raved about them. Cons: the sizing/fit seems to vary and there's debate over whether or not they're squat-proof.

Don't take any chances with these leggings. This pair were specifically designed for those 5'5" and above so you'll never be bothered by short hemlines again. You can wear these either bunch up around the ankle or over the heel, which I especially love for barefoot workouts like pilates and yoga. A comfy wide waistband and pockets add major points too.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Great for tall figures; Can be worn two ways; Has pockets; Sweat-wicking; Squat-proof.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Limited color choices.</p><p><strong>Customer review: </strong>"These are amazing! As a women over 6’ it is very dry hard to find leggings that don’t fit like capris. These are very long to the point where they bunch up at my ankle which I like. The material is also thick, durable and soft which makes them great for working out or just lounging around."</p><a href=# data-model-name="SHAPERMINT Leggings for Women" data-url="https://www.amazon.com/SHAPERMINT-Leggings-Women-Shapewear-2X-Large/dp/B09MR4WVMF/ref=sr_1_12?" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FSHAPERMINT-Leggings-Women-Shapewear-2X-Large%2Fdp%2FB09MR4WVMF%2Fref%3Dsr_1_12%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id=1471 data-merchant-url=amazon.com data-merchant-network=Amazon readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/niHypAFiqL3i6EG6XziACX-1920-80.jpg><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Shaping Leggings on Amazon</span></p></a><p>SHAPERMINT Leggings for Women</p><p>For leggings that put the focus on shaping rather than working out, SHAPERMINT leggings are the way to go.
