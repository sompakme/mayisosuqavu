That sound like a choice,” adding, “It’s like we’re mentally in prison.”</p><p>Goldberg explained to him that for centuries black people were treated like “animals” in the United States. “You change the laws, you change the mentality,” she said, “but you can’t pretend that people were just saying, ‘I’m gonna stay here, because this feels really comfortable for me.”</p><p>Co-host Sunny Hostin said it was “dangerous” that West was not only “ignoring the history” but also ignoring the “institutionalized racism” that exists in America to this day. In an emotional moment she recalled when her father told her that she is the first person in their family who has “full civil rights.”</p><p>“So the fact that Kanye West is being taken literally by people, that he’s a spokesperson for African-Americans, I think it really disturbing,” Hostin added.</p><p>Meghan McCain, meanwhile, said that West “looked like someone having some kind of breakdown” and said it reminded her of when Britney Spears shaved her head as part of a public meltdown. “This doesn’t look like someone who’s well to me.”</p><p>But when McCain also noted that as a political analyst she “did not understand what he was saying” about his <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>apparent shift towards Trumpism</a>, Joy Behar came up with another analogy.</p><p>“He’s a performer,” Behar said. “Kellyanne Conway talks and I don’t understand what she’s saying either.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVfqbWmedWinLBlk6S6sa3Rnqpmo5GjxqZ51p6qrWWkpHqssculsJqmnpp6pLvNsJiyZZGbwaa%2BjKyjmq6Vp8Zur86mpJ6mpKg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
