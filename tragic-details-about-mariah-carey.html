In 2002, she told <a href=#>The Guardian</a> that she couldn't legally discuss her older sister, but added, "Let's just say that there was a lot of stuff that made me become the responsible one and I've remained in that role."</p><p dir=ltr>In her 2020 memoir, however, Mariah claimed that Alison mutilated and drugged her (via the&nbsp;<a href=#>Independent</a>). "When I was 12 years old," the singer wrote, "my sister drugged me with Valium, offered me a pinky nail full of cocaine, inflicted me with third degree burns and tried to sell me out to a pimp." She alleged that Alison deliberately put her in unsafe situations, exposing the youngster to her boyfriend, John, who allegedly attempted to assault her. "Dysfunctional families are ideal prey for abusers, the exposed little ones vulnerable to being picked off," Mariah reflected. Moreover, she claimed that her brother, Morgan Carey, was violent and almost killed their mom, per <a href=#>The Sun</a>, and that the two also&nbsp;allegedly concocted a plan to extort $5,000 from the star.</p><p dir=ltr>Speaking to The Sun, Alison vehemently denied her sister's allegations; she refuted Mariah's recollection that she threw scalding hot tea at her, claiming that she dropped the beverage by accident. Following the allegations, Alison filed a $1.25 million lawsuit against Mariah in 2021, as reported by&nbsp;<a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>. The following year, her brother followed suit, though a judge rejected the majority of his claims, per <a href=#>Forbes</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or someone you know is dealing with domestic abuse, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1−800−799−7233.
