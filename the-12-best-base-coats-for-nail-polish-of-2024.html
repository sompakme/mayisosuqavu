However, there’s one important twosome that’s oftentimes disregarded&nbsp;— base coats and nail polish. While, yes, you can use one without the other, there’s a reason this pairing exists. “A base coat acts as a solid foundation for any nail polish application,” explains nail technician and cosmetologist Alisha Mathis. Aside from just prepping the nail bed for polish, base coats can also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>strengthen nails</a>, ensure polish doesn't chip, and even provide much-needed nutrients.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">So, how do you find the right base coat for your nails? We got you covered. We researched the best options on the market, taking into account what ingredients they’re made of, how long they keep nail polish from chipping, and how well they work when it comes to protecting natural nails. Ultimately, we found 12 knockout base coat formulas that make polish last longer and keep brittle nails from peeling.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you want to nail your at-home manicure or are looking for the perfect pair for your polish, these base coats will provide a sturdy foundation for any lacquer.

This top-rated brand has a vast selection of lacquers, including this impressive base coat. Infused with biotin, it nourishes, fortifies, and strengthens nails both on the spot as well as over time. The inclusion of this powerhouse ingredient ensures that nails stay healthy, providing them with the nutrients needed to prevent peeling and breaking. On top of that, this base coat works well with any nail polish, guaranteeing the lacquer does not stain nails, which is a game-changer for those who like to wear <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>dark nail polish colors</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While there’s so much to love about this product, the one thing we will note is that it does take some time for it to fully dry (anywhere from five to 10 minutes if you apply one coat, and 15 minutes if you apply two). To speed up drying time, we suggest blowing on your nails or using a fan.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 0.46 oz<strong> </strong>| <strong>Finish: </strong>Glossy<strong> </strong>|<strong> Formula: </strong>Vegan, 8-free</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-la-colors-craze-base-coat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L.A.

Colors. For just under one dollar, this ensures your nail polish stays chip-free for up to a week. We love that this base coat also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>doubles as a top coat</a>, so your nails won’t only be primed, but your polish will also stay protected. And, what’s more, this lacquer leaves behind a high-shine finish that makes both natural nails and bright hues pop.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For the best results, apply one layer of base coat and let it fully dry. (Because this formula is a bit thick, this can take up to 15 minutes.) Then, apply a coat or two of nail polish, and follow with a thin layer of this top coat. Voila!

This chic base coat differs from the rest due to its translucent white finish (and high price tag). The subtle white hue makes <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>DIY-ing the glazed donut trend</a> a breeze, but unsurprisingly, it’s also just as functional as it is eye-catching.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This luxe lacquer protects nails from breakage and deeply nourishes them, thanks to the addition of avocado oil, apricot kernel oil, and aloe leaf extract. It also keeps polish from staining the nail bed, which in turn helps with yellowing. One note: Just be sure to apply this polish slowly and evenly as it can sometimes look streaky if you put it on too fast.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.5 oz<strong> </strong>| <strong>Finish:</strong> Glossy, translucent white |<strong> Formula:</strong> Cruelty-free</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-ellamila-firm-foundation-nail-hardening-treatment--base-coat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ella+Mila Firm Foundation Nail Hardening Treatment + Base Coat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ella+Mila Firm Foundation Nail Hardening Treatment + Base Coat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-EhSquBA6Djd3SMOnIe9FGLbkA4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ella-mila--firm-foundation-nail-hardening-treatment---base-coat-c7870ee3214246968d247947620ca2a2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This product contains garlic bulb extract, which is a natural antioxidant that strengthens and hardens nails.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The consistency of this polish is very thin and almost watery.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Give your nails the pick-me-up they need with this strengthening base coat. Formulated with garlic bulb extract, this Ella+Mila favorite provides both short- and long-term benefits, including hardening nails on the spot, as well as promoting future growth. Additionally, this base coat acts as a glue for nail polish, securing it to the nail bed for up to a week and a half (read: No chipping). While some base coats don’t leave behind a shiny finish, this one is beautifully glossy and can actually double as sheer nail polish.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only thing we will point out is that the consistency of this polish is thin and watery, so just be sure you don’t apply too much.

Made with horsetail extract and hydrolyzed silk, this base coat instantly strengthens nails and supports future growth. It also utilizes vitamin B and calcium, both of which work to harden and fortify nails. Plus, what’s not on the ingredient list is equally notable: This base coat is made without 10 harmful toxins frequently found in nail polish. Not to mention, it’s also cruelty-free.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.4 oz<strong> </strong>| <strong>Finish: </strong>Matte<strong> </strong>|<strong> Formula:</strong> 10-free, Cruelty-free</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-strengthening-sally-hansen-advanced-hard-as-nails-strengthener></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Strengthening</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sally Hansen Advanced Hard as Nails</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sally Hansen Advanced Hard as Nails" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/VM31AjMQ9KQNegefcjL2uXnFWh8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sally-hansen-hard-as-nails-nail-hardener--3ba04f226672414bb39b5eeb0de03be2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This affordable base coat instantly strengthens nails, making them less susceptible to breakage and peeling.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The smell of this polish is very strong.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“My favorite strengthening nail polish base coat is Sally Hansen’s Hard As Nails hardener,” says celebrity nail artist and CEO and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>NailBiz</a>, Aaliyah Smith. “It has fibers in the polish that help strengthen, thicken, and fill ridges in your natural nails.” As a bonus, this product is made with omega-3 and soy, both of which nourish and hydrate nail beds.

Be sure to store in a cool, dry place not in direct sunlight to get the most use out of it, otherwise the polish will start to get stringy and result in a less than perfect manicure.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.5 oz | <strong>Finish: </strong>Matte<strong> </strong>|<strong> Formula: </strong>Vegan, 10-free</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-chip-resistant-londontown-grip-lock-base-coat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Chip-Resistant</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Londontown Grip Lock Base Coat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Londontown Grip Lock Base Coat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/jGxLFdVtZ1r0jYYn5zDgXa2OCOY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/londontown-grip-lock-base-coat-669852622bd84e48bc41c5c403414079.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This plumping polish is tacky, which helps it cling to nail lacquer.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The brush is on the thicker side, so if you have small nail beds, the polish might get on your skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This plumping base coat provides a secure grip on nail polish, ensuring it doesn’t chip for days on end. The formula itself is a bit tacky and sticky, which allows it to act as glue, immediately latching onto lacquer. Speaking of the formula, this product is made with a slew of good ingredients including rapeseed flower oil (which strengthens), cucumber extract (which hydrates), garlic bulb extract (which fortifies), evening primrose oil (which restores), and vitamin E (which is anti-yellowing). These <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>good-for-you ingredients</a> make up for the ultra-thick brush. While it makes it easy to coat nails in one fell swoop, those with smaller nail beds may want to switch it out for something a bit thinner to avoid mishaps.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 0.4 oz<strong> </strong>| <strong>Finish: </strong>Glossy<strong> </strong>|<strong> Formula: </strong>Vegan, 8-free, Cruelty-free</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-brittle-nails-opi-original-new-nail-envy-original-nail-strengthener></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best For Brittle Nails</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>OPI Original New NAIL ENVY Original Nail Strengthener</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="OPI Original New NAIL ENVY Original Nail Strengthener" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/zLJJtl_0k-GOFtee8pEfq5qK69c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/opi-original-nail-envy-nail-strengthener-3c57b13018024d7cb62d52ececa8195d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This base coat is made with hydrolyzed wheat protein and calcium, which makes nails longer, harder, and stronger.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It can take up to three months to see significant results.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Brittle, weak nails stand no chance against OPI’s iconic nail strengthener.

Try to also stick to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>non-toxic nail polish removers</a> and polishes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for what you should look for, opt for products with nail-care ingredients like soy, vitamin E, calcium, and zinc.

Base coats act as barriers between the nail polish color and the fingernails, which helps defend nails against staining and peeling. They also help keep polish from chipping, and help to harden and strengthen nail beds.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Do you need a base coat for nail polish?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Base coat is an absolute necessity when polishing nails,” explains Smith. “Base coats help to adhere the polish to the natural nail. You’ll get longer wear out of your color with a base coat than polish alone.” And, contrary to popular belief, base coats aren’t the same as nail primer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Primer is used for acrylic nails and gel manicures,” notes Smith. “It helps the acrylic and gel adhere to the nail enhancements by removing oil from the nail plate.

Additionally, Lauren researched top-rated products to find the best ones that are safe for nails, keep polish from chipping, and strengthen nail beds.
