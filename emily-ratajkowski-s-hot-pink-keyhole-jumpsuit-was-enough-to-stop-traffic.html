But her latest eye-catching look involves a very bright hot-pink jumpsuit from The Andamane with a huge chest cutout and a crisscross halter neckline, and it's literally stopping traffic. Today in New York City, EmRata was hard at work filming an ad for Maybelline New York and as she posed and strutted through the street, but it was her eye-catching outfit that undoubtedly made everything around her come to a screeching halt.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ratajkowski paired the skintight jumpsuit with coordinating pointy heels, matching gloves, and an oversized, strong-shouldered black coat that fell past her knees. She had her bangs on display, of course, and her hair was parted down the middle. Her look's finishing touch was a pair of huge silver square-shaped earrings. There's no news just yet on which Maybelline product she'll be fronting next, but with a look like this promoting it, it's sure to be unmissable when it hits the shelves.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jose Perez/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">EmRata's history with Maybelline goes back —&nbsp;way&nbsp;back. She's starred in ads for the beloved drugstore brand since at least 2016, when she posed for a campaign that&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>also featured</a>&nbsp;Gigi Hadid, Christy Turlington, and Adriana Lima. In 2019, she name-dropped the brand's Great Lash clear mascara as her go-to brow products in a video she did revealing her favorite beauty tricks with&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Vogue</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't feel like a normal person unless my eyebrows are brushed up," Ratajkowski said as she brushed the clear gel through her signature thick brows. "To me, there's nothing sadder than an eyebrow when it's smushed down. So, this is a key step, and I try to do it pretty early on."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xKagpbFdp661rcmkprCrm556qbvTZqeipptiuKbFx6ijnmWaqrqxv9Siq2alka6vprjLoqWeZWhpfnd%2FkWw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
