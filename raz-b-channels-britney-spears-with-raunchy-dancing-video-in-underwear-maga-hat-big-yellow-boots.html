Still, there are some mildly inappropriate things that are acceptable for public consumption, such as Britney Spears' salacious dancing videos. She's been breaking the internet with each new post we've seen, and it seems that Raz B is stepping up to offer the mother of two some competition.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Late on Thursday (September 7) evening, the Bad Boys Texas cast member uploaded a video that leaves little of his body to the imagination. Raz donned a bright red MAGA hat with black underwear and a pair of MSCHF's <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Big Yellow Boots</a> before recording himself dancing promiscuously in his kitchen. "Ladies this one for you!" he wrote in the caption, also adding "#MagicMike."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-raz-b-shows-off-his-dance-moves-in-a-questionable-outfit>Raz B Shows Off His Dance Moves in a Questionable Outfit</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"What in the MAGA <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Mario</a> Super Mario brothers is happening here?" one user pondered in the comment section. "What in the Britney Spears 2 Wong fu nappy chest hairs wresting panties auntieâ€™s belly coke head s**t is going on here?!!!!" another person hilariously reacted. "Somebody please f**kin tell me!"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While not everyone is on board with Raz B's saucy new video, some are pointing out that he's not the only one to post content like this. "He just minding his business having a lil fun ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£. Itâ€™s cool when Britney Spears do it, itâ€™s a problem when he do. F**k em ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚," they joked.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-b2k-star-shows-love-to-britney-spears>B2K Star Shows Love to Britney Spears</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Interestingly, the R&B icon shared a shoutout to the Pop Princess just hours after his NSFW post went up, hinting at a new single in the caption.
