He has since moved on to better things, including his first-ever pro boxing match.</p><p><a href=#>Fish later left AEW</a>&nbsp;after he wasn’t happy with&nbsp;<a href=#>how he was being booked</a>&nbsp;at the promotion. He also&nbsp;<a href=#>eviscerated CM Punk</a>. In fact, his beef&nbsp;<a href=#>with CM Punk happened for good reason.</a></p><p>Fish won his professional boxing debut on the Floyd Mayweather vs Deji undercard. Fish opened the show, as he squared off against Ghanaian boxer Boateng Prempeh.</p><p>Fish won the match around a minute into the second round. It was officially a KO victory, but Prempeh indicated that he had suffered an arm injury when the official initiated the count and Prempeh was unable to answer.</p><p>One spot during the match resembled pro wrestling as Fish appeared to lift his opponent over his head, but he sat him back on his feet rather than slam him as this reflexes almost took hold.</p><p>Fish recently confirmed that he signed a two-fight deal with Global Titans in an interview&nbsp;with<a href=#>&nbsp;MCW Backstage Pass</a>.</p><p>“It’s a two-fight deal. So I’m definitely fighting twice. This one has to be boxing.</p><p>“The next one, I would really like for it to be kickboxing or MMA because that’s what I’ve done. I’ve been doing martial arts since I was a kid and that’s what I love.”</p><p>We will have to wait and see what the future holds for Bobby Fish, now that he has established himself as a proper boxer now. We do know that he will fight again. You can check out his first fight below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>Are you happy for Bobby Fish?
