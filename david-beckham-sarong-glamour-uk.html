But in a new interview, he's insisted he has no regrets and would don it again. That's our boy.</p><p>Speaking on ITV show Lorraine from New York, where he's just launched a fashion line with Belstaff, he said: "Sarongs are great. That's one thing I never regret because I thought it looked great and I would still wear it now.</p><p>"Over the years it's not just myself, everybody looks back at old pictures of themselves and thinks, 'I can't believe I wore that, or I wish I hadn't wore that, or what was I thinking?'</p><p>"You make mistakes over the years or you wear things that were right at the time."</p><p>And he also admitted that while VB doesn't have the final word, she's not shy of putting in her two cents when it comes to his clothing choices: "She has her say ... well, she has opinions. I'm my own person so I think if something looks good then I'll wear it. But she definitely has opinions over the years about certain things I wore.</p><p>"When you're in a relationship, when you are married then you trust their judgement. And she's got a pretty good eye."</p><p>He also gushed about how proud he is of his wife's rise to fashion icon: "I'm very proud of what she's achieved, what she's done. To go from being a Spice Girl, the biggest girl band in history, to be respected in the fashion industry, that's something that doesn't happen overnight.</p><p>"To see the scale of what she's created is special." Sweet.</p><p>But even better was when he started talking about Harper Beckham - apparently she takes 20 minutes to get ready in the morning and even gives him fashion advice.</p><p>"All little girls are like this, honestly it's amazing to watch," he said. "She'll come in and she'll want to put my belt on or she'll want to dress me or she'll say "Daddy wear these shoes with that", it's amazing actually."</p><p>TOO CUTE.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjApqauqp2WtKLGyKecZ5ufY8Kse8Crq6KbnJp8pa3VoptmmpWYuKmtzGadmquYnryvedaorKWcXayyor6ManBycF2orrO7zaBkmp%2BRnrs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
