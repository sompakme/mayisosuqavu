F.R.O.G stands for finished room over the garage – which is pretty self-explanatory.</p><p>During this episode, the teams will have to renovate entirely new spaces, including the bedroom as well as the garage. The episode description teases that “the teams aim to leap to the front of the competition.”</p><p>The four teams are deep into the competition now and if you haven’t been watching, the shoe follows the couples as they all renovate exactly the same property in Charleston, South Carolina. They each have a budget of $225,000 and all compete to earn the highest appraisal rate.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I'm watching this house make over show 'Rock The Block'…and they redid this bedroom.
