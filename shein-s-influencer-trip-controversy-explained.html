The fast fashion&nbsp;behemoth, best known for its&nbsp;dubious labor practices and&nbsp;environmentally destructive production model,&nbsp;invited influencers to&nbsp;visit its Chinese facilities in what appears to be an attempt to reframe&nbsp;itself as an ethical company.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">One influencer who took part in the trip, Dani Carbonari (better known as @danidmc&nbsp;on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Instagram</a>),&nbsp;has gone viral for a video documenting her visit to "the factory of the leading manufacturer of SHEIN," as well as the company's "innovation&nbsp;center." Carbonari, who describes herself as an "investigative journalist," says she was "excited and impressed to see the working conditions” at both facilities.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Carbonari also claims that she spoke to an employee at the SHEIN center's fabric-cutting department. "She was very surprised at all the rumors that have been spread in the U.S.," the influencer says, perhaps referencing&nbsp;a viral investigation by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">British outlet Channel 4</a> that found evidence of labor law violations at several SHEIN factories.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">"My biggest takeaway from this trip is to be an independent thinker, get the facts, and see it with your own two eyes," Carbonari continues. "There's a narrative fed to us in the U.S. and I'm one that always likes to be open-minded and seek the truth, so I'm thankful for that about myself."</p><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Tiktok.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Carbonari's account of the trip resembles those&nbsp;shared by her fellow travel companions, including Aujené, Fernanda Stephany Campuzano, Kenya Freeman, Marina Saavedrawas,&nbsp;and Destene Sudduth, who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">claimed</a> SHEIN workers get "a nap-time after lunch."</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">The entire&nbsp;group was swiftly criticized for glossing over the&nbsp;well-documented reality of SHEIN's inner workings:&nbsp;The company <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">underpays its workers</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">rips off independent designers</a>, and omits approximately <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">6.3 million tons of carbon dioxide</a> a year, thanks to its staggering output —&nbsp;on average, it updates its website with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">6,000 new items a day</a> (according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The Fashion Law</a>, fast fashion rival Zara releases 500 new items a week).</p><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Twitter post.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Netizens also questioned Carbonari's claim that she was not compensated to go on SHEIN's influencer trip.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">"I was not paid for any trip or to say anything," she said in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">now-deleted response</a> to her critics. But in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">TikTok&nbsp;</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">video&nbsp;from May</a>&nbsp;(also deleted), Carbonari said she signed a deal with SHEIN after meeting with the company to discuss&nbsp;bringing information "from the brand to the consumer" and "debunking a lot of these rumors." She stated: "As a plus-size creator, I am 60 percent of the time underpaid, and they [SHEIN] have definitely not underpaid me."</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Carbonari posted a second response video, this time to Instagram, in which she concedes that she should have done more independent research before accepting SHEIN's brand trip. The influencer claims, again, that she was not paid to attend the trip or post about it — however, her travel and accommodation were covered, a point that many&nbsp;raised in the comments section of her video.</p><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Instagram post.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Others are leveraging criticism at <a href=#>SHEIN</a> itself, questioning whether&nbsp;the company showed influencers a staged facility. "This is so completely real guys. So real," one&nbsp;user commented on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SHEIN's TikTok</a>&nbsp;video&nbsp;documenting the trip.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Faux factory or not, it's important to note that SHEIN doesn't own its entire supply chain. While it might own the&nbsp;pristine-looking "innovation center" shown to influencers, the company largely relies on a network of&nbsp;third-party&nbsp;manufacturers throughout China.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">To repurpose&nbsp;Carbonari's proclamation: Be an independent thinker and get the facts. Influencer videos that were probably paid for by SHEIN&nbsp;aren't exactly the most reliable source of information.</p><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Tiktok.</p>Enable All Media<h3 class="title___VeFRS family-sans-black-upper--s___rT0g3 productModuleCarouselTitle___fBA3w">Shop our favorite products</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbXGoaqnp5KesrXFjZympmegZMCpscinZKKmlqHCprrCnqlmrKKevW6vzqerq6emmr%2B0xY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
