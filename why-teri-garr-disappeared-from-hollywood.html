She continued, "Someone who takes care of things, copes. So, I was conditioned to do that." That model has helped Garr remain optimistic throughout her health struggles. Garr said her mom would wear a pin that read "EGBOK" when she was working long hours to support their family. And that acronym was short for "Everything's going to be OK."</p><p>In turn, Garr is now a role model to her own daughter, Molly O'Neil. Garr and her first husband, John O'Neil, to whom she was married from 1993 until 1996, adopted Molly in November 1993. Molly has been by her mother's side during many of her public appearances, and she was the one who found Garr unresponsive at home following her 2006 brain aneurysm. Garr told <a href=#>Closer Weekly</a> in 2015, "[Molly] is a great example of what inspires me and what I live for. She is always there when I need her."</p><p>The Closer Weekly interview also revealed another permanent fixture in the Garr household: Rosa Diaz, who is the actor's aide. She started with the family as Molly's nanny and says she loves working with Garr, who, Diaz discloses, is "nonstop" every day, always wanting to get out into the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGxlZX94e9ahsGaslae2brPAq6lmnJmorrG8xJqpnpxdm7%2BwuYyhpqWkqay8sLCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
